        "content": "A bit disappointed in this one, which is a shame because I think the core of the game itself is good but there is just a bunch of small issues I have with it that stack up to lessen the experience for me.\nProbably my biggest gripe with this game is the gameplay. For the most part, Strikers's gameplay is fun, frantic and engaging. It adapts a lot of Persona usual mechanics and gameplay like All-Out Attacks, 1 Mores and Persona skills really well into the hack-n-slash genre. I really did enjoy this game's combat... for the first 10 or so hours. After a while the combat just turns into repeat the same few combos over and over again until all the enemies die. There's barely any challenge and it starts to get really repetitive, especially if you're doing the requests. Another small gripe I have that turned into a pretty big one was that, out of all things that were brought over from the original Persona 5, the game did not bring back sharing EXP from battles with all the benched party members. This leads to nearly all of the characters aside from the three you pick for your party and Joker to be very underleveled, which is a bit of a problem in some bosses, especially the final boss which requires you to use all of the party members for it.\nOther than the gameplay, the story this time is pretty uninteresting. A lot of the story's themes just feel like a retread of the original Persona 5's themes, which I know sounds like a stupid complaint considering this is a spin-off of P5 but other Persona spin-offs like Persona 4 Arena also had similar themes to its original but also added more on top of that. The only other message this game offers other than rebellion is that AI can be used terribly in the wrong hands, which is a nice message but it doesn't really correlate back to or add on top of Persona 5's already existing themes like P4A\nThere is one thing I do really like about this story though and that's interactions and chemistry of the Phantom Thieves. This might be a hot take but I much prefer how the thieves act as a group here than they do in the original. They feel a lot more like an actual group of friends, where as in the original Persona 5 they felt like people who were only friends because of their connections to the Phantom Thieves. It's probably because of this game's more chill setting of a holiday but the characters are able to shine a lot more as friends than they ever did previously.\nI know I've sounded very negative in this review but if you did enjoy Persona 5 and want a follow-up on its story with some faster gameplay then I would definitely recommend this game. Just lower your expectations a bit when jumping in.",

I originally bought this game to play it again since i have already played once but this time i wanted to have a good experience with better grapphic and 60 fps and what i got was an solid looking game with constant stuttering when youre in combat. But to note i heard there are some things you can do to fix it but i think it should not be the consumer who has to make the game run well. But if the game runs well it is a great experience",

        "content": "While I'm not the type of person who enjoys many hack and slash combat in games, I actually found this to be quite enjoyable, even though it was pretty difficult at first. I ended up getting all achievements for it, which is some very high praise for a genre of combat that I dislike. I love the Persona series but I came into this game kind of half-hearted. As an spin off of Persona 5, I didn't really expect this game to have much to it besides some story. However, I was surprised to see just how well the game actually was. The fusions have some unique mechanics to them as compared to Persona 5 and the game did a really good job at making a hack and slash enjoyable (for me). The story was also pretty good too and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall, I think this is a great game that you should try if you're looking for more after beating Persona 5. (Yeah, you should play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before playing this.)",

You might have to use Process Lasso to use it since the game lags and starts to freeze frame. But overall the fighting mechanic is great and so is the music. The new characters have their own moves, Yuskue who is somewhat overpowered with his last combo, or atleast when he was used. Story is great and the characters seemed to have their own personalities from Persona 5. It is different from the turn to turn base to a realtime battle but I think it works very well.",

The only thing that worked for me was someone's suggestion online to install \"Process Lasso\". With this, and only this, was I able to play the game normally. \n\n- Game is so repetitive and dull fight wise. This is probably my fault cuz i came into the game expecting it to be something like Dynasty Warriors since I saw the game tagged with \"musou\". So i was like \"WOW, a JRPG and musou, gotta try that\". Welp, no. It didn't do it for me xD\n\n- Most times, the dialogues are boring and just unnecessary, like they talk way too much when there's no need for that.\nAn example:\n-Person X is feeling down-\n-The friend group tries to cheer X up- :\nPerson A: Hey dont't be sad, it'll all turn out well.\nPerson B: Yeah we'll all work together to solve this issue, then you won't have anything to worry about!\nPerson C: Eactly, what Person B said! We shall stick together and never leave you alone in this!\nPerson D: Ohohoho, dont't forget, we're the Phantom Thieves after all. We help all those in need!\nPerson X: Aw you guys ;-;\nPerson E: hehe, cmon cheer up already!\nPerson F: Yeah cheer up!\nPerson G: Cmon X, a smile suits you best!\nPerson X: Thank you guys <3\n-Now Person A to G all start replying one after the other-\nLike literally why does the whole group have to reply on every single thing T_T This made me skip like 75% of the dialogue. and only read main parts and story explanations. Oh, sometimes even the explanation and plan discussions take TOO LONG so i skip that too x). At this point i started not giving a fuck about the story too, sadly, hehe :^)\n\n- The way they set up Achieving the side quests is messy imo and made me feel like it's such a chore..\nand the rewards for them weren't .. rewarding.\n\nPROS: \n- Game brings back personas and skills from Persona 5, so yay. That didn't change when it switched to musou, hack n slash.\n- Makoto.\n- I liked the fact that they move from a city to another. I'm always excited to know which place is next.\n- You can buy ingredients and cook :D\n- Think it had a decent plot twist.\n\nCONCLUSION: \nOf course Steam doesn't have a neutral rating button. It's either a YES or a NO xD and I'm more of an in between here :^)\nIt's not all that bad if you speed run throughout the game like I did xD If you wanna buy it, then do so on sale and never on full price ._.\nBtw, I spent about 35 hours on the game, the rest was afk ops x_x",

        "content": "Actually so close to being good. Unfortunately on a 4070 it's still plagued with many issues with crashes and lag that gets you killed. Crashes that reset hours of your progress. Hell I lost SAVED progress. Not to mention the game still expects you to do the most boring thing, GRIND, and more grinding. Hard mode wasn't hard, it was just more HP for the bosses. Quit at the first palace boss because of this. 3 times I've died to the boss at 1 HP, lowering the difficulty and I noticed only her health amount changed. I still did 1 or 2 damage each on the boss with sometimes 8-10 weakness hits. \nThe boss fight was brainless doing the same move spamming Y on Ann, and XXY on joker with nothing else different. I was really let down by the combat of the game, which is a shame. So much potential wasted by forcing old JRPG tradition of trying to force the player to give up hours of progress to go back and grind.",

Also dodging sometimes makes the window 1/10 its size, because the developers did not account for system shortcuts, when they set the default keybinds.",

        "content": "Simple warning. While this game has the \"Dynasty warrior\" gameplay, you only get short fights without territory control mechanics. it's basically an action rpg with heavy emphasis on the hack'n'slash. \r\nWhile a sequel to P5R it is not required to have played the previous game. But it will help to know who's who and what everyone is able to access. Also some plot-related spoiler.\r\n\r\nwhy does it take hours to finish the intro?\r\n...because you get interrupted every 5 second of gameplay. the only time you aren't stopped right in your track while doing something is during cutscene. \r\nI got four separate pop-up window, stopping all gameplay, to tell me I can use a special attack when the enemy is down.\r\nOne for the basic information... cool. thanks. I'll make use of that. \r\nsecond to tell me I can do the same when I down an enemy with an attack... well duh, I pretty much got that from the first one... why not tell me at the same time?\r\nthird to tell me I can do the same when I down the enemy with a status effect.. Couldn't you just include this in either of the previous pop-up or as followup information? no? why wait 5-10 seconds before telling me this. why tell me at all? I thought this was an ACTION game...\r\nFourth to tell me I can do the same when I down the enemy with an attack using their weakness... ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME?! Is this game for children with ADHD so severe they can't read or press buttons?\r\n\r\nThis is just an example. Those four didn't come at the same time. I managed to get half a combo in between each. And to make matters worse, I got ANOTHER pop-up in the NEXT battle saying the same thing, but this time it was to tell me I can down an enemy and look up tutorials to know more. \r\n\r\nThis is a sequel.\r\n\r\nSure, the genre change a lot. Some of the mechanics are pretty different. You can actually do the special attack on ANY downed enemy and it will also hit any enemies near the target.  (NEVER MENTIONNED/SPECIFIED IN ANY OF THOSE STUPID TUTORIAL leaving players of the prequel thinking they might need to down more than one or all of them... one try is enough to know those facts, but I needed four tutorial to know I can do the same attack on ANY kind of downed enemies? After the first one said pretty much that?) \r\n\r\nI am annoyed.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the SAME GAME that throws you in a fight the very moment you start, with no explanation of any kind. Throw the cub down the cliff, dont say anything and leave. Sure, I'm a gamer, I can figure out the very basics on my own. Move, attack, trial and errors style... also the HUD show some buttons so I pressed them to see what it would do. etc. \r\nThat's how the very first fight starts. it's not until you defeated a bunch of enemies that you finally get a clue on what to do.\r\nWith a big fat interruption pop-up. Jump there, do this, go there. Progress, sure...\r\nthen mindless banter and \"press forward\" moments for like 20 minutes. not so bad considering...\r\nYou know... I've had countless DOWNED enemies, Used a lot of special attack on them. Got all out attacks, special animation, weird combo. but it's only 2h in that they give me the pop-up... WHILE TRYING TO INFILTRATE MID-JUMP. ofc I miss the target, it insta-drop me as the one ambushed.\r\nthen interrupt after my first hit (nothing got downed). ok, got it, do the same as I did so far. good talk tutorial. I get a few hits in, the second oen pops up. go away, I don't care anymore. i kill a few enemies. another pop up. and then another mid-combo.\r\n\r\nyou know what kind of tutorial pisses me off the most? THAT KIND. Don't interrupt gameplay, dont force a pause in the middle of the action. don't take away my focus. I almost finished the first chapter or whatever and I still have not had a full fight without pop-up interruption. story or progress-related ones are fine, but those pop-ups are a plague.\r\n\r\nScrew this. I shouldn't have bought this even if it was 70% sale. it's not fun.\r\nLoved the prequel, this sequel is stupid. bypass any logic previously established. Two of the character have different voices. Ann looks like a beach bimbo rather than a student and/or fashion model. Social is BOUGHT, levels are BOUGHT. Velvet room is cruelly lacking (the attendant is a cutie but that alone is not enough). \r\nAs for the plot... you are immediately pointed at BEFORE you even get into town for some similar-looking crime as before. I know Japan IS ACTUALLY THAT DUMB when it comes to accusations and believing said accusations, but come on... So go play with the obviously deranged pastel-colored queen-wannabe and the two obviously swapped AI. Can't say more than that as I've yet to progress further. Most is actually speculations but whatever. Getting a tutorial pop-up to tell me how to fucking press a button 2 hours in when I've been doing that nonstop since the start is hella dumb and annoying.",

This game is just so incredibly boring and does nothing but assassinate established characters by making them extremely exaggerated. Nobody had a considerable glowup coming from P5 except Haru for me, but that's because P5 didn't care about Haru and would rather dillydally with Morgana instead.\n\nSpeaking of which it is a bit relieving that Morgana is no longer an exposition horse but goddammit this cat is still so annoying. The urge to punt his american football-shaped head is immense. But hey now don't worry, Chat-GPT waifu is here to be the new exposition horse. I'm so glad 8 year olds can always follow the story of P5 and now P5S.\n\n2/10 for simply making me like Haru more and the fact that it's not as outrageous as Tactica. For the love of god stop milking P5 Atlus.",

Some of them need low-leveled Persona to be high level to be fused. The grinding takes a while. \nDungeons' objective where we have to collect 3 items before facing the boss is kinda repetitive. \nBattle is kinda janky (takes time to master), but I still love it overall.\n\nI like that Konoe's dungeon design is as good as Shido's (big, detailed, but not boring). \n\n8.5/10",

        "content": "THE GAME DOESN'T WORK RIGHT! The game is neat itself but you have to do so much to achieve meh performance. The game is very poorly optimized. I'm running a 3060 12gb w/ i7 and 16gb of RAM with the game on an SSD and I'm lucky if I can reach the 60fps lock. At least, I used to be until I downloaded Process Lasso and did some other tweaks which brought me to a semi consistent 60. Still though, before I did that, I was getting maybe 20fps. Like playing GTA Online in a full lobby on an original PS4 that's never been dusted. This game will make your computer beg for mercy. Not really, but it'll at least seem like it.\r\n\r\nAnd because of all that, I can't recommend the game. I only recommend working games. This works less than 7 Days to Die walking alongside a pond with water FX turned all the way up. This game is like trying to play R6 Siege w/o the latest drivers, or like trying to launch any Ubi game that isn't compatible with the newer Uplay. It's like trying to play the launch release of Fallout 4 w/o any patches, minus the hard crashes. You won't crash when playing this game but you will soft lock if you try to load the 5th boss fight. Isn't that neat?\r\n\r\nThis game's resolution always looks bad, too. I can't really tell what's wrong with it but the menus always tend to look like they're a quarter of the resolution they should be. Looking at the menus is similar to trying to read a book through a glass jar.\r\n\r\nIf that game goes on sale for $5, go for it. It's still a pretty cool game. My problem is that the development team was clearly lacking in the technical department and they've decided to let players fix most of the problems they encounter which is unacceptable. They pulled a Bethesda real hard too, considering their DLC bricks that one boss fight.",

As a fan of both, I was thrilled to dive back into the Metaverse alongside the Phantom Thieves.\n\n\ud83c\udfae Gameplay: 5/5\n\nThe combat system is a delightful blend of real-time action and strategic planning. Swapping between characters feels seamless, and executing stylish combos against Shadows is immensely satisfying. Plus, the inclusion of the Showtime attacks adds that extra flair we all love.\n\n\ud83c\udf06 Story and Characters: 5/5\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back, and their camaraderie remains as endearing as ever. The plot unfolds beautifully, weaving together personal struggles, friendship, and the overarching mystery. New characters like Sophia bring fresh dynamics, while familiar faces like Joker and Morgana feel like old friends.\n\n\ud83c\udf38 Visuals and Music: 5/5\n\nPersona 5 Strikers retains the signature aesthetic of the original game. The vibrant, stylized visuals pop off the screen, whether you\u2019re exploring Jails or enjoying a quiet moment at Leblanc. And the soundtrack? Pure bliss. Shoji Meguro\u2019s compositions continue to elevate the experience.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Overall: 5/5\n\nPersona 5 Strikers captures the essence of the original while introducing exhilarating gameplay twists. Whether you\u2019re a Phantom Thieves veteran or a newcomer, this game is an absolute steal. So grab your mask, summon your Persona, and let\u2019s steal some hearts!",

If this is what the Press X Many Times Warriors franchise is offering:  I look forward to pressing X many more times in the future.\n\nAny recommendations on what is best?  Perhaps Press X Many Times with Samurais?  Press X Many Times with 3 Kingdoms Heroes?  Perhaps maybe even Press X Many Times with BOTH Samurai AND 3 Kingdoms Heroes?",

The best goofy AA action game I've played in years, all said and done.\n\nThis game is a little strange. It feels much lower budget than Persona 5 itself, but stays so close to the uber-polished presentation style that you almost don't notice it. The writing overall is a little... off or cheap feeling, but the writing of the main characters is so incredibly on-point that it really won't bother you. The dungeons seem extremely formulaic, but just when you start to get bored with the pattern things start changing up on you -- the Kyoto boss was really fun.\n\nAnd the combat... I can't think of a better way imaginable to present Persona 5 in a real time hack and slash. Once you get into it, it's AMAZING. It takes the best of the Warriors series, the high points of P5, and creates a strange but pleasant amalgamation of the two.\n\nIt's not what anyone could have expected Persona 5 Two to be, but it sure does feel like that's what it is.",

The game freezes up randomly and MAY start playing again, otherwise I have to close out of the game, and sometimes the game will just straight up crash on its own.\r\n\r\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, I was just starting to get a feel for the controls and seemed like it was going to be fun but the bugs I am running into are making it entirely impossible for me to play.\r\n\r\nAnd don't get me wrong, I have attempted to fix this game on my own. The most common solution I have seen is running Process Lasso. Everyone seems to say \"I just installed it and ran it in the background and it fixed everything\". Good for you, that doesn't work for me though. I have tried numerous different fixes, searching through forums and watching videos on youtube but none of it has been able to resolve these problems. This game has been on Steam for around 3 years and it still runs like this. It's a joke and I can't believe this hasn't been fixed already. Perhaps I'm just the unlucky one where my system is perfectly designed to not run the game right and you'll have more luck running than me, but given my experiences with this game, I cannot recommend this game to anyone",

        "content": "I'd consider sweating my ass off in merciless difficulty to obtain all achievements if not for the FUCKING VOICE-OVER LANGUAGE SELECTION POP UP EVERY DEATH, you just keep mashing your *A* button to retry the battle and it selects the voice-over you didn't intend to select (git gud and don't suck the high pixie's humongous dildo i guess).\n\nRaging and kidding aside, this game has been 69 hours of satisfying grind, Persona dialogue that has you smiling like an idiot with your mouth open the whole time, and heartfelt story up until the very end for me, and I even thought i'd go for full achievements as a token of appreciation, but decided against it, since this turned out to be quite the task, which isn't bad by any means, it's just quite a mental challenge, and i'm not up for taking it after having such pleasant fulfilling experience with my medium difficulty play-through, i fear. That said, i just suck. For the people who are good at videogames, I'm sure this is an additional bunch of nice challenging stuff to clear and achieve the god gamer status.\n\nA little bit of a backstory: as someone who would call Persona 5 a masterpiece, the \"Royal\" arc from Persona Royal, or whatever people call it idk, the -new semester additional content-, left me disappointed. \nPersona 5 has such an insane fulfilling ending and playing through that additional semester felt out of place and wrong to me, i didn't care nor like the events that occurred after what was an epic culmination of that story.\n\nThat being said, this game, however, didn't feel out of place at all. The new characters all felt crucial and got their screen time, got time and effort put into their development by the devs.\n\nThe journey overall felt heartwarming and bonding besides the fact that it's a hack&slash game without the usual dating sim aspect, which is I guess the strength of GOATLUS. It still felt like playing a good sequel to the original Persona 5 compared to that Royal arc that I didn't care about nor like, even though it felt like 60% of the time you are fighting and 40% you are reading the dialogue. \n\nIt is a sequel to Persona 5. As someone who spent 190 hours in Persona 5 Royal, I thoroughly enjoyed spending 69 hours in Persona 5 Strikers as well. It has a good story, super chill iyashikei vibes, a fun hack&slash battle system, you level up your personas, characters, bond level, master the combos that allow you to do some very fun goofy stuff in combat.\n\nYou put enemies into a meat grinder while reading quality dialogue and watching multiple stories of different people you meet on your intriguing journey unfold, the emotional investment forces you not to miss a single line, - so be ready to perform the ultimate gamer move - reading the dialogue while simultaneously mashing your buttons in correct order in attempt to win the battle WHILE wiping the tears from your eyes not to miss a crucial move or a crucial piece of text with all that popping on different sides of your screen.\n\n11/10 story, classic Persona vibes - especially considering it's a hack&slash game (mixes JRPG in there)\n11/10 new characters - depth, emotion, philosophy, \"villains\", motives, goofiness, kindness, bonding\n10/10 combat - mechanics, combos, skills, interactions with objects, master arts - versatile and satisfying\n9/10 grinding - feels satisfying and rewarding for the most part, although i admit i kissed Billiken statue's soles for like 3 hours and it's not the proudest thing i've done in my life for sure.\n0/10 merciless mode, the Cock on the Cockmobile and The Reaper aka The Rapist - unplayable for noobs like me\n\nOverall, sums up to a score of 41/50 which converts to 82%, so here ya go, my verdict is that it's a solid successor to Persona 5, a must-play experience after finishing the OG, but do keep in mind that it is indeed different gameplay-wise. Nah, who am I kidding, who cares, who wouldn't want a similar game to Persona 5 where you travel across Japan with the same cast? Banger, try it.",

The game has worse graphics than the orignal title and differnt controls but that is to be expected because its not made bu the same people as p5 and p5r. overall id give the game a 8",

        "content": "It's not a bad game, it just looks that way because it's a direct sequel to Persona 5. One of the \"I wish steam reviews had a \"meh\" option\".\n\nThe story acts as a direct sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) so the characters are all there and are as great as before. Unfortunately everything else about the game is lesser in every way. \n\nThe world is a lot more linear with the slice of life aspect being almost completely absent, the combat is a nice change IMO but best played on easy so enemy health and damage work well with enemy density (any difficult above the lowest turns even basic mobs into damage sponges and powerhouses), the story is \"what if Persona 5, but again?\" but held up well by characters both new and returning. \n\nIt's these cons that make it very difficult to get into nearly as much as Persona 5 which is required reading if you want to get what's happening in the plot.",

        "content": "THE STORY IS A SEQUEL TO P5's MAIN STORY, PLAY P5 OR P5R BEFORE YOU PLAY THIS.\n\nIt's pretty fun, story feels like a legitimate sequel to P5 main story instead of how most Persona spinoffs work outside of the Arena games (kind of) and it is canon to P5's story as a whole so it's not pointless like PQ's story. Keep in mind it is a Dynasty Warrior styled game, I feel it is more Persona than Dynasty Warriors, but just keep in mind that if you don't like Warriors games you probably won't like this game. Story is good and fun, music is great as per usual, the new characters are great, specifically like Zenkichi, hope Persona games have more characters like him in the future.\n\nMerciless difficulty is more similar to something like Ultimate Vault Hunter mode from Borderlands 2 than it is to Merciless from P5 or something like Maniac mode from P3P (though it is closer to Maniac than P5 Merciless). It's very much a mode where you test not only your endgame Persona builds, but also just your general understanding of the combat, it is not for everyone and it is also NOT a requirement outside of only starting it for an achievement. I saw someone else review the game negatively purely because of Merciless mode and I don't think that's fair at all, as Merciless is purely an endgame challenge mode for players who want the challenge, you can also just do a regular NG+ without Merciless mode difficulty.\n\nOverall it's a fun game. Only reason my playtime seems low is because Steam didn't log my playtime correctly due to internet issues, my playtime is closer to 70-80 hours",

The gameplay is pretty much what you an expect from the Musou Series, but there is an incredible attention to details on this one. It's fun, it's fast, the story is awesome, the new characters are really cool and the INCREDIBLE music is still there... but with an action twist now. \r\nReally, P5 is a masterpiece, and P5S is the perfect game for those, like me, who wants more.",

        "content": "For a Persona game it's definitely out there with the new combat style. But it definitely works for what it wants to be. The story itself is good as well as the music being fantastic as always But I do have my problems with it. \n\nComparing to persona 5 I much prefer the system they have for fusing personas. Having multiple ways to fuse, item fusing and generally how its laid out. The jails themselves while being fun I feel are a little too short in the game. Personally I would prefer the game having a run time of about 50/60 hours without doing a completion run just to fill it out more. A little more interaction with the characters as well would be nice, having maybe a 1 to 5 confidant level for your group to hang out with them and learn some new tactics or something. Having the new tactics learnt by playing those specific characters in game just seems a little cheap. Also the controls for the game are not that great and to get a playable control setting for yourself does require quite a bit of fiddling.\n\nPersonal Nitpick - I would love if in P5 if you romanced one of your teammates they remember it in game and there is some story too it there. It feels like a huge miss for the folks that romanced Ann for example and then she makes no mention or interaction whatsoever about it with the player. \n\nAll in all though the game is great and I do recommend it to people, but if your wanting a more  normal persona experience either play Persona 5 Royal or new game plus. 7.5/10 would be my rating for this.\n\n(Also not enough time with Coffee Dad)",

        "content": " I could never tell you this game was bad by any means. In fact I enjoyed most of my time with it, but it also feels kinda out of place in an RPG series. It's blatantly a Dynasty Warriors clone that takes place in the Persona universe with RPG elements shoved in to make it feel more at home. As such, fans of that series are going to love this, I'll wager. I'm not one of them, and if anything my holdups felt like reasons I wouldn't enjoy that series.\n\nBut that said it is a very focused experience which (again, unlike most RPGs) will not give you any chance to explore much outside the path the story gives you (which as I think about it is quite ironic considering the themes of the series and this game in it in particular), so if you are the kind of player who gets lost in side stories and never actually finishes the game despite wanting to see it through, this is probably for you. In addition, this game is about as true to the Persona 5 experience without remaining the same game as is possible due to it's presentation, so fans who wanted to visit Joker and his friends again will also get exactly what they wanted out of it.\n\nIf there is anyone who should avoid this game, it's ironically the people who came here wanting an actual RPG experience. That is not what this is despite the series, and furnishings of it included. So if that's what you want, you will likely find what you are looking for starkly missing. \n\nOh and unless it's a cheap way to get the background music from the rest of the series into battles, SKIP the deluxe edition. The extras are absolute trash beyond that.",

It's like \"weird science\", only it takes itself seriously. Combat is just bad. It's fast and cluttered, visual effects cover the screen, you don't see what you're doing most of the time, so just mash the buttons in pattern of your favorite combo and hope that you're doing something useful.\n\nThe one redeeming factor are the social interactions within the group. P5R already fixed that to some degree by adding some group events, so our cast looks more like a real group of friends. But without social links and helping other people solve their problem, I would still call this a failure. Oh yeah, the anime-mandatory scene \"boys accidentally perv on girls in the bathroom\" is there. Apparently, this is what the P5R game was missing. You can decide for yourself whether it's worth 60$ for you.",

Gameplay is fun and of course, repetitive but that isnt anything worth mentioning in a persona game cuz they all obviously are which doesnt deter the games fun(for most that know what they are getting into and already love it). I find it more difficult than the main games because shits flying everywhere at all times instead of turn taking and well thought out strategy which can hit you upside the head considering weaknesses can easily scr3w ya over lol. Anyways, long story short, good spin on persona and happy for the continuation of a story for the same group as before which being a new persona fan I believe is a rarity or almost non existent? But yes, Its fun, play it.",

        "content": "I don't know what everyone's talking about; I love the combat in this game. I can admit it is a bit button-mashy, in that the optimal way to deal with enemies is to farm for 20 hours and simply spam their weakness, but you really don't need to play this way. \n\nDishing out a few combos, perfect parrying the boss, baton passing all around and executing even more combos with characters who play totally differently, obliterating everything with a Showtime attack, using the environment objects, getting actual helpful help from Oracle to remember how to hit technicals, taking advantage of stagger windows and long windups to do longer combos which then deal a crit, which leads to an All-out-attack, which charges everybody's Showtimes up again and... there's so much dopamine flooding my brain that I can't even make a proper sentence out of this. It's all so well thought out and it very cleverly combines Persona's style with a combat system that isn't turn-based.\n\nNow, one of the side effects of combining Persona with not-Persona is that, despite it being possible for the player to no-hit every fight (every enemy has immaculately telegraphed attacks and it's brilliant), you're still fighting with a team. If you neglect your team's armor, or their level, or try to go up against end-game opponents early on, they just get annihilated, leaving you with <1/4 of your DPS, and you need that DPS, unless you're down for a 30+ minute solo fight. Strikers is [i]hard[/i], way harder than you think it is, and if you play [i]on hard[/i], every big enemy is a tank, and they hit like one. So, you still need to go through all the preparations that you're used to from Persona to be up to par for a fight, and you also need to be good enough at the combat to win. I kind of hated this at first, but I also hated Persona 5 for this at first, so it makes perfect sense.\n\nRight, onto everything else, in no particular order:\nThe time management and social stuff is much less of a focus (Like, almost not a focus at all)\nThe characters are what you'd expect, except Haru really steps it up this time\nThe music is bonkers. Outstanding. Insanely good.\nStill too much filler dialogue, sadly\n\"Palaces\" are less interesting (I didn't find them interesting previously, so no big deal for me)\nMenuing can be a bit sluggish (Still looks cool, though)\nVisual clutter during big battles can be a problem\nLiterally zero performance issues...? I'm not sure if they were fixed or if I'm just lucky",

Because of this, I was extremely skeptical of this game. Sequels, as many know, tend to drop the ball and have it shatter into thousands of tiny pieces for things like this. Not all the time, but a definite handful of times. This game is weird with how it handles that ball. Characters and story? Spit-shined at every moment so when you take a look at it, there is always a cartoonish sparkle to it. Gameplay? It has some scratches that seem a bit too deep to buff out.\n\nIf you are like me, then you can understand a game's value by it's price tag. Ignoring gems that should cost more, or ones that should be less than they are worth, quality and price still have a slight tendency to go hand in hand. For what I am about to say, put yourself in the mind of yourself when you are 10 years old, you go to the game store to buy a game, and box art and price is all you have to go off of. \n\nThis game should be worth $40. I know that is so much words for such a weird way to put this, but for the people who understand what I am saying, will have a brainblast when buying this game and understanding exactly, TO A T, what I mean. \n\nSo, enough of this useless obscure gaming blog rambling, here are my thoughts straight up ***NO SPOILERS***\n\n***IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PLAYING***\n\n     Time does NOT progress unless the story says so. You can leave and re-enter jails (this game's palaces, theres a good reason for the name change) at any time. Hanging out with friends also takes up no in game time. \n     You have all the time in the world to finish requests up until the VERY end of the game. Even then, when you finish the game and save, you have a post-clear game that is not new game +, but you have to playthrough to get NG+. It sends you back riiiiight before the last fight with some new requests\n     Persona fusion is WHACK. Don't expect what you get from Persona 5.\n     There is NO EXP SHARE. You gotta have each character in your party if you want them to level up. \n     There are no confidants/social links in this game. It's replaced with a BOND meter that fills up over time in the story, by cooking food, hanging out with friends, and fighting. its not at all, and the way its used is honestly awesome\n\n***THE BAD, AND ANNOYING***\nTo start with the bad, this game's gameplay loop is repetitive most of the time. It is enough to cause it to genuinely becoming grating over time. A bell curve is pretty much the best way for me to explain how this game feels to play. Of course, this is the nature of hack and slash games, but still. It does a lot very well with the hand it is given, though it can get annoying at times. \n\nCharacter balance is a mess. You will primarily have the same-ish team for most of the game, because the other characters are just mediocre at best. Imagine 3 teammates as Persona 5 Royal makoto, the rest as Persona 5 Royal's Morgana. 3 teammates are literally busted. you will feel it, the most busted one is one that i can only describe as legitimately, no DLC end game persona 5 royal Joker. genuinely insane skills + heat riser + debilitate + enduring soul + a collection of damaging skills that is BONKERS and genuinely should not be on one character. Theyre a character that is what feels like end game P5R akechi should have been. \n\nThe fusion system is bad. Some personas you need to level up other personas to ABSURD levels in order to fuse them. King Frost is one of them, requiring a level 40 Pyro Jack and Level 40 Jack Frost (both of which are no where close to that level) in order to fuse. I'm too lazy to go back and reword this whole part of the review to add in how the fusion system works. But its just you choosing from a list, not you choosing a persona and which to fuse it with. Its gross.\n\nThere are plenty more bad things in this game to be aware of, but it is 12:48 am on a school night, I have a show in the morning and frankly, i just want to explain what makes me happy about this game. \n\n***THE GOOD, THE GREAT, AND THE FANTASTIC***\n\nIf you skipped to this part of the review, then hell yeah. i gotchu, i know what you want and ill give you it.\n\nWhen I tell you how this game handles characters is phenomenal, i mean it. if you can believe it, the characters in this game have so much more personality than Persona 5. It feels like a real group of friends. By repeated mentions of in-jokes that dont just feel like \"haha look fans! remember this funny reference! love us for the fact that we are faithful to the source material!\". And additions of new on-going bits and jokes, this game genuinely is what Persona 5 fans needed for the continuation of this story. The voice acting is SO good (for the old cast, im not a fan of 2 of the new characters' voices until the very end of the game). While on the topic of this, I would love to bring up the fact that while the persona 5 anime is not great, the voice acting is terrific. ESPECIALLY Ryuji. The delivery of jokes could not have been better and were done perfectly every single time. You could feel the raw energy and power in the scenes you needed to feel that. \n\nThe best way I can describe this game's characters is like it feels as though is it just one really damn big improv session with the voice actors. To the people who get what I am saying and know how real those feel: yeah. I know what I am saying and I am telling you it feels just like that. There has never been a game that has caused me to laugh out loud by the jokes. There has never been a game where I scream at my screen for a character to do something, and they do it, and have me flip out. There has never been a game that could get me to genuinely feel something even with the most cheesy of lines. This game is phenomenal in all of those regards, and my mom could probably testify that this is the only game ive ever played that has had me this excited and vocal. \n\nNow shifting down a gear to say something that I like but not as much, the story is good! its really enjoyable, and the game is predictable enough for you to know where it'll go soon, but just a bit unpredictable to have you still be excited and have a lot of fun and have you being like \"wait what?!?!\" in so many places. Its the prefect blend of predictability that causes you to feel smart for piecing things together while also not feeling like when you do so you are an adult destroying the questions in Dora the Explorer. \n\nWhat I like about this game is that since Morgana is now new to this to, you actually get to theorize WITH the characters, instead of having a question that you have IMMEDIATELY answered. There is another exposition mule in this game though, like how Morgana was in Persona 5, but it is not nearly the same. They come in just when you need it or whenever you need something to push you to getting more clues.\n\nDidnt know there was a character limit to steam reviews, so lets rap it up.\n\n(one quick thing before TL;DR 2, the music isnt as good as persona 5. its generic action game music with a hint of persona 5)\n\nTL;DR 2: This game is a love letter to Persona 5. This game also gets annoying to play, then it gets bearable, then enjoyable. It is worth the frustration and annoyance. Buy this game only when its on sale, however. anything above $40 is too much for this game.\n\nThank you so much for reading this review. I have comments on, and Im more than happy to answer any questions. I hope that this review can help at least ONE person who is on the fence about buying this game. Thats all i care about.\n\nTake care everyone :)",

        "content": "First I do recommend this game, but there are a lot of caveats. \nI'm pretty sure you can find from other people why this game is good so I'm just going to write the problems I found with this game despite recommending it.\n\n1. The pacing, it's kind of slow. It goes from exciting to then you eat a meal, then exciting, then you do this. There is no countdown of days to the end of a palace and feels like it is dragging out towards the end.\n\n2. The gameplay. This is not a fun game. This isn't like other Musou games where the enemies are all on screen, this game has enemies spawn after you approach a shadow. This means you have to start and stop combat constantly which can get annoying.\n\n3. The combat is stiff feeling. Doesn't have a satisfying feel like most other hack and slashes. Dynasty warriors has a better feel than this game. In a turn based RPG, you'd normally plan each move strategically, in this game is basically an attack spam fest of weaknesses with some dodging.\n\n4. Getting upgrades is a pain in the ass since you have to revisit other dungeons and move around them.\n\n5. The game has a cutscene around every corner. This isn't like the original game where an action causes a cutscene, or it occurs in important parts in dungeons. This cutscene often happens randomly, you never know how long they are and watching a shadow morph into some demon every few seconds is annoying after a dozen or so times.\n\nWith that said. I still do recommend this game if you can deal with the shortcomings on design.",

The genre is also not everyone's cup of tea, but if you are a big fan of this series id say its worth a consideration on a sale. 7/10",

It's a sequel to Persona 5 (minus the Royal content), but never spoils anything too bad from said game. The character writing and voice acting is on-par with P5 as well, which includes some of the bad elements. The game began to become a slog for me at the end, though, so get it while it's on sale - and when the last Dynasty Warriors clone you've played has been a while ago.",

        "content": "\"Persona 5 Strikers\" is a title I wholeheartedly recommend, albeit with an essential piece of advice for fellow fans: revisiting the original \"Persona 5\" will significantly enhance your experience with \"Strikers.\" This isn't to suggest that \"Persona 5: Royal,\" with its expansive narrative alterations, should be your precursor. Instead, the authentic and unaltered journey offered by the original \"Persona 5\" sets the perfect stage for what \"Strikers\" has in store.\n\nHaving journeyed through \"Persona 5 Royal\" myself, transitioning to \"Strikers\" felt somewhat jarring. The expectation to continue the enriched narrative of \"Royal\" made the shift to \"Strikers,\" which follows the original's storyline, feel disjointed. This experience highlighted the unique narrative paths of each game and the importance of aligning with the original \"Persona 5\" narrative to fully appreciate \"Strikers.\"\n\nDespite this initial dissonance, \"Strikers\" captivated me with its compelling story and engaging gameplay, embodying the spirit of the \"Persona\" series. It invoked a sense of nostalgia and a desire to revisit the original \"Persona 5,\" not just as a return to its roots but as a way to bridge my experiences between the original game and \"Strikers.\" This revisit isn't about recapturing the unfamiliar but rekindling the familiar and deepening the connection to the \"Persona\" universe.\n\nThe presence of \"Persona 5 Royal\" on Steam, with its enhanced gameplay and narrative depth, makes the idea of going back to the original \"Persona 5\" seem less appealing, especially considering the hardware switch back to the PS4. Yet, the narrative continuity and the charm of the original game hold a special place that \"Royal\" can't entirely replace, particularly for those of us looking to complete the journey into \"Strikers.\"\n\nIn conclusion, \"Persona 5 Strikers\" offers a rich and rewarding experience for those who have traversed the world of \"Persona 5.\" While \"Royal\" presents a polished and expanded version of this world, the unique storyline of \"Strikers\" calls for a reunion with the original narrative. This game is a testament to the enduring allure of the \"Persona\" series, inviting veterans to re-engage with the past to fully embrace the present.",

        "content": "To the point\n==================\nA stylish Musou style game that Persona 5 fans will love, but others might not know what they're buying\n\nGood Stuff\n==================\n++ Cleared on Hard Mode ++\n\n- I'm a fan of JRPGs who played P5 a long time ago and I can confirm that the story here, which is a canonical continuation, is great. Feels like a natural evolution of the already strong narrative and it was nice to catch up with familiar characters.\n\n- The game really incentivizes you to keep your team rotated by changing up the vulnerabilities per dungeon\n\n- Without the timing system from the first game, you can be a lot more leisurely with going into and out of dungeons to explore and level up without worrying about missing things\n\n- The soundtrack is really great, most of the classic tracks from P5 have been remixed and match the more frantic pace of the game.\n\n- Battles are just quick enough where they're fun to grind and try out new strategies.\n\nBad Stuff\n================\n\n- If you do NOT like or have a low tolerance for Weeb stuff, pass on this one cause it hits every trope\n\n- So this was initially pitched to me by a friend as a Musou or a dynasty warriors style game. It is absolutely not. It's more or less an action game with an explorable map. For me this didn't hinder my enjoyment but if you came here looking for a Musou style game you'll be disappointed.\n\n- Normal is incredibly easy, as in you can let you AI teammates do a lot of the work while you hang out. Hard is very punishing in the first dungeon but evens out later, just keep in mind even with grinding you'll be getting 3-4 shot through a majority of the game.\n\n- The bosses, which are the centerpieces of games like these normally, are kind of sad here. They look interesting enough but you're given lots of tricks to defeat them (that you can choose not to use of course). There are a large majority of elite enemy encounters that are much harder.",

It\u2019s Persona 5 with real-time combat.\n\nThe stylish scenes and vibrant art style remain true to the series' signature aesthetic, delivering a visually captivating journey.\n\nOne of the standout features is the game's soundtrack, which not only pays homage to the acclaimed music of Persona 5 but also introduces new tracks that complement the dynamic battles. \n\nThe well-written story is another highlight, seamlessly continuing the narrative from Persona 5 and introducing new challenges for the Phantom Thieves to overcome. The character development and interpersonal relationships maintain the depth and charm that us fans have come to expect from the Persona series.\n\nIn my opinion, Strikers is a worthy addition to the Persona 5 universe. More so than Persona 5 Tactica.\n\nPlays well on the Steam Deck at 60 FPS.",

        "content": "It's an interesting game in that it shows how the persona series would play if they were action games instead of an rpg. However, since it's just a spin-off, it doesnt compare to the greatness of the main titles. Nonetheless, the story is good and there are enough elements from persona 5 to make you feel invested and finish the story. \n\nThe actual gameplay feels really smooth sometimes, gets boring other times with you just pressing a single button to ambush and insta win, and other times it feels like you are just avoiding tons of stuff flying at you while your teammates die because the AI decides to tank attacks instead of moving away. Joker is the weakest of all the team, which is a problem since you can't bench him, and while fights are generally fun, some are really tedious, bosses being difficult only because they are damage sponges and have millions of hp. This gets compounded in merciless difficulty with mobs being able to one shot your team with a single ability. Did not and will not try to grind anything in this game or complete merciless, unlike in persona 5. \n\nAlso, there's really no choice in interacting with your team, other than 3 or 4 events where you choose to hang out with  one of them and get a cutscene. Understandable for a spin-off, but these interactions were part of what make the persona games great. \n\nMusic is good. \n\nOverall good game, would recommend getting on discount if you want more persona after finishing 5.",

        "content": "This being a \"Spin-off\" or even calling this is a \"Spin-off\" should be enough to distort your heart\n\nFor someone that played the original Persona 5 and its currently playing Persona 5 royal together with a buddy\nthis is everything but a spin-off\n\nIt actually does the opposite of what you expect from a spin-off, it enriches the cast while making the new characters just as equally interesting and enjoyable,BUT I AM SO SAD I WILL NEVER SEE ZENKICHI IN ROYAL :(\n+1 favorite character to my book alongisde Yusuke and Ryuji (THE BOYS!)\n\nSophia story as a AI gave me (for the lack of better word in my vocabulary) new light on how i see AI in real world and giving AI atleast the benefit of the doubt despite how its being used in today's world\nnot gonna lie, her speech gave me tears (don't wanna spoil so i will say its the speech she gives when in \"mementos\")\n\nIchinose while you could say was lacking screentime in the early game even after she's been introduced, the end of the game really expanded more her reasoning and personality, made me like her alot more, also sad i won't be seeing her in Royal...\n\nOh,i forgot about to talk about gameplay...uh....\n\nfor joker i sticked with arsene to the end as best i could, after the twins/[spoiler]Lavenza[/spoiler] opened the option to level up your personas and their individual starts, i never bothered to level up other personas BUT arsene, yes i had other personas for either buffs or magic abilities that i would need, but priority number 1 persona was arsene and arsene only\nHow i built arsene was to be flexible\n1 gun skill\n1 melee skill\n1 Ailment skill (preferably sleep)\n1 Buff/debuff skill\n3 passives (1 to nullify his ice weakness)\nand i had no problem with this setup\n\n\nI had no problem, in the begginign i was overwhelmed by the amount of different movesets and playstile each characters had, Morgana and Haru are extremely strong when it comes to technical attacks, too me over half the game to understand how strong their technical attacks were, so for morgana i always tried to have either Ann or Joker with a fire persona to burn the shadows (Sleeps also works too, ironic)\n\nSkull,Fox,[spoiler] Wolf [/spoiler] and Noir are like your melee/gun damage thugs\n\nFox more about Combos that last for almost forever and countering attacks while also dishing alot of strong criticals, if there was a boss-shadow that none of your current thieves could deal with effectively, Fox Constant active damage thanks to his Counter-mid combo always ensured you could keep attacking so long you timed your counters and combo counters\nand if shadow does not have any weakness, just crit it to the ground!\n\nSkull is the most likely the \"Bruiser\" of the thieves as he has the highest burst damage on charged attacks while also boosting the highest base defense,or endurance in this case, Flinching being non existant with his personal buff (Not the \"charge\" ability, although it just makes him even more absurd in burst damage)\n\nNoir is kind of odd, she has acess to both Technical damage and gun damage, while also having both PSY, Ailments and Gun boosts, i still haven't cracked down her playstyle, but i can say from the time i played with her she is indeed very strong with both PSY, ailemnts and Gun attacks, she definitly shouldn't be played with endurance in mind, shes can't really take a punch like the guys (Morgana even less so, but balances out by having the highest agility to dodge attacks)\n\n[spoiler] Wolf is a \"high risk-high reward\" playstyle with his Fury mode, atleast before he unlocks a art that reduces the HP-draining during fury, His attacks are always wide swings that have higher chance of dealing critical damage, not to mention his persona is almigthy based with some Melee and gun skills, focusing on buffing himself and landing criticals to keep the refreshing his current buffs, goes very well with his \"Heat riser\" ability he learns later on, if you wanted to destroy a boss-like shadow, wolf is your man, also can i say his outfit alongside the awakened of choice are FREAKING AWESOME?, A CLAYMORE?!, I LOVE YOU! [/spoiler]\n\nPhanter,Mona,sophie and Queen were the \"supports\" of the thieves, Ann less so since she is much more focused on FIre damage with a twinkle of healing sprayed\n\ni honestly haven't cracked down Queen playstyle yet, but i can say her buffs and healing were very helpful, alongisde her easy to access Combos with innate Nuke affinity, think of her as a \"Spellsword\" or \"Battlemage\" of the thieves, also just as durable as skull\n\nIf SKull is the Thugh, Phanter is the Wizard, being able to apply burning by either basic attacks or persona abilities really goes well with Queen and Morgana for Technical damage, while also having atleast some small way of recovering SP unlike the other Thieves that canno't recover SP unless you use Items or support from Oracle\n\nMona has the highest Technical damage and the best \"oh shit everything is going wrong!\" healing ability by about level 70\nReviving, healing to full, cleansing ailments all in one package for when shit goes wrong, mona pairs very well with fire or sleep de-buffed enemy, as sleeping enemies can be technical hitted from everything they are not immune to\n\nSophie is likely the best healer all around, but she lacked the means to revive teammates, to be frank, i din't play enough sophie yet to be good enough with her combo game, but i was not ignoring her gimmick of catching her yo-yos mid combo (not counting the times i had her in my party as AI, she was very useful, ALSO THOSE THIGHTS)\n\nAilments, unlike Persona 5 royal and original, CAN affect bosses (except the last boss) and makes them VERY strong\nHaru being able to FEAR a friggin Dire shadow is HUMONGOUS of a help, you do however need to get the bond skills to trigger more realibly, alongside some luck boost\n\nby level 5 in ailment rate trigger chance, you will trigger ailments 100% of the time, no exceptions, and its kind of nuts how strong a 10-12 sp cost ailments can be since they affect not just 1 enemy\n\nI'm gonna finish this by saying this: i also loved the gimmick on the last boss fight, TAG TEAM WITH SKULL AND JOKER NEVER FELT SO SATISFYING AND CINEMATIC",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers continues its story after Persona 5 Royale, bringing back its lovable original main casts for another tale which takes them across Japan.\n\nOmega-Force (Koei) has a hand in developing this, hence Strikers possesses a mixture of Dynasty Warrior and Persona 5 mechanics. The overall gameplay sets you off in exploring huge areas called Jails, which are the equivalent to Persona 5's Palaces but with its own set of rules. There is more emphasis on counter-dodge, baton passes, and elemental switching in combat. This makes battle exciting and keeps you on your toes, rather than the usual hack-and-slash that are seen in many Koei titles. Essentially, enemies will knock you down hard on mindless button mashing.\n\nMusic is a big part of enjoying Persona 5, and Strikers did a great job in not only arranging the base Persona 5 tracks, but also has outstanding original vocal tracks of their own. It very much fits the style of Striker's gameplay and enhances them.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Striker's is a great spin-off to Persona 5 Royale. There are gripes such as the loss of QoL that are present in Royale, the content outside of battle is minimal, and a lot of menu-ing, but that didn't deter me from enjoying it.",

If you're looking to spend time with some more time with the beloved characters from Persona 5, I say sure go for it, but don't expect any drastic or meaningful interactions with them. The general premise of the story is very similar to the original game so far. The combat is fun! Reminds me of the old Dynasty Warrior games. My only complaint with the fights are that it can feel clunky at times with limited movement during combos and the camera movement does not help either. Have not finished it yet, and I don't know if I will, but I still recommend it if you love the world of persona and it's themes. 6.5/10, not worth the full price, would wait for a generous sale to buy this one.",

        "content": "Love the combat in this game! Story's not as good as Persona 5, but it's still enjoyable. Plus the Phantom Thief theme just fits so well as an action game!\n\nBiggest gripe from me is that the combat feels like it's held back by trying to shove in too many Persona 5 mechanics. You can play this like a musou game, but the most efficient strategy is to spam Persona skills to take advantage of weaknesses, technicals, etc. And even if you're not doing that and decide to play it like a musou game like I did, you still need to bring in other characters to maintain buffs and debuffs, or else combat just takes so much longer without being more fun.\n\nYou also need to actually buy gear for your characters (and it's [i]really[/i] expensive to buy that stuff!) so you're basically committed to using 1-2 characters at the start of each dungeon, which actively discourages you to try out other characters. It's especially bad for Joker whose viability is based on how much you're willing to fuse Personas for him. It was a fun thing in Persona 5, it was [b]not[/b] fun in this game!\n\nOverall, still a lot of fun despite all my gripes. I would just see myself enjoying this game more if it had just taken all the extra effort from forcing in all the Persona and RPG elements like Persona skills, fusions, gear, elemental weaknesses, etc, and put all that effort into doubling down on Mastery skills to make combos more interesting and rebalancing bosses accordingly.",

No, the gameplay is really flat compared to its predecessor. Every world is pretty formulaic, but the story is serviceable with it taking the experiences from Persona 5 and having the characters relate to the villains through their own shortcomings. The combat is the biggest difference in this game and at first it feels a lot better than Persona 5's combat, but after a while it can get pretty stale and even sluggish at times if you don't have the right team comp. I wish this game had the exploration and depth of Persona 5 to be charging for a fully priced game. I got it at a steep discount and even then it feels like a chore playing through the game.",

        "content": "As a followup to Persona 5's story this is really fantastic. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this game, but the story sucked me in and it carried me to the finish line. The gameplay was pretty fun too.\nFirst off this game is not a turn based JRPG like Persona 5. This is more akin to the dynasty warrior games where lots of enemies are on the screen and you do lots of attacks to defeat the enemies. The thing is that this game works in so many systems from Persona 5 that it truly feels like a sequel despite not being the same type of game. Personas level up and learn new moves. There is a bonding system for you and your party that gets worked into a skill tree. It just feels like the creators cared and really tried to work in as much as they could from Persona 5 into this game.\nI personally don't really care for dynasty warrior style games and I still loved playing this and had a great time. I wouldn't pay full price for it unless you like dynasty warriors style games, but if you are a Persona 5 fan and this is on sale then I can highly recommend it.",

        "content": "A super strong extra chapter in the story and characters of the Phantom Thieves.\n\nI think if you loved Persona 5's world, story, characters, music etc. you will enjoy this game.\n\nThis game does't feel like \"just a spin-off\" it really feels like a Persona 5: 2. One of my favorite parts about the narrative is it really does feel like a full road trip/adventure with the gang you got in P5. All too often in JRPGs you get all your party members assembled at the last moments and can feel their chemistry for a only a short few hours. Since this is a continuation of P5 story the whole game has that full team chemistry through it. But still retains the character growth with new characters.\n\nThe only thing that might turn you off of this game is the combat. It seems to be hit or miss for a lot of people. I personally found the combat fun after a few hours, I'm not a huge fan of chaotic beat em up type combat but it still felt well designed and still captures the feel of persona combat.\n\nI'd say this game is worth you're time, just don't try to compare it to base Persona 5 / Royal too much. Just sit back turn that OST up and enjoy the ride.",

        "content": "The Best way I can describe Persona 5 Strikers is a throw back to the Spin off games of the late 00's that were on Portable Systems.  In fact if someone told me this started out as a PS Vita game in development and moved on to PS4/PC when that system was ended.  I would have believed them.  The first thing that came to my mind when playing it was KH Dreamdrop on the 3DS with its love of open parkour.  If could forgive them if that was the case but when those games like KH portable titles or Crisis core were made by in house Devs.  Strikers is a Keoi Techmo spin off so if you don't know that means.  Butts and the same tired Dynasty warriors power fantasy game play from 20 years ago.  If you like way to many crap filling your screen and jumping in head first.  You will like this game.  The best parts for me are the Parts from Persona 5 that carry over like the dialogue.  The charm in the characters and new characters are right out of Original game.  It doesn't take long to see though that corners were cut.  Characters are mentioned but don't appear.  The relationship system has been removed.  Royal is treated like it doesn't exist even though it came out a year before this.  Beside the characters, this really isn't a Persona game but takes itself far to seriously to be treated like the spin off Dancing titles.  Oh and this game claims to have anti-aliasing but you could have fooled me.  If you want to play this, treat it like a Portable game and play it in small  doses when you need a laugh.",

        "content": "Gameplay is good BUT the performance on high end PCs is poor.\n\nThe exact cause of the stuttering on high end PCs have is due to the game artificially limiting itself by not using all the cores of the CPU. This issue apparently has existed since release. A simple fix of going into task manager and manually selecting all cores exists but a game that sells at \u00a355 shouldn't require going into task manager to make it function.\n\nA few other things like not automatically going full screen & mouse camera movement not locking during dialogue are present. Also all settings are locked until a certain point in the story when some unlock then even later do the entire settings unlock.\n\nYou'd be best buying during sales or on PS4.",

I love how you can play with everyone and each of them are viable, fun and good for different situations.",

It's a happy reunion for those who miss the crew after the ending of P5(R) and makes sure to highlight growth within some characters and provides proper spotlight for some (Looking at you Haru). Overall the combat will be what makes or breaks it for anyone. The dialogue is fun and the music is always vibes. I had a great time finding my own flow for how I wanted to experience combat and it allowed me to use any persona I wanted regardless of power or type. This one offers both style and substance and is well worth it for any fan of P5 but I wouldn't blame you if you waited for a sale.",

Action combat is a fun blend of Musou style mania and SMT strategy, and knows how to deliver impact. Every character feels unique and you're given almost everyone right from the get-go, so there's lots of time to master every single moveset. Every fan of Persona 5 should give it a try, it is absolutely worth every second.\n\nAND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE MUSIC-",

        "content": "Koei Tecmo has a history of reskinning Dynasty Warriors with a popular IP for easy cash, so when I saw Koei Tecmo in the startup splash screens, I was cautiously optimistic. After all, I hadn\u2019t played Dynasty Warriors in two decades and had fun with it for a while, and Atlus had a lot of control over the design of Persona 5 Strikers. So, as someone who recently completed Persona 5 Royal and found this game waiting to fill the emptiness of finishing such an outstanding game, I gave it a spin.\n\nThe combat, first, is more intricate than Koei Tecmo\u2019s other musou games. The incorporation of the large roster of personas and their strengths and weaknesses gives it a complexity that the SMT/Persona series is known for. The combat, however, is still Dynasty Warriors to the core, and has the same problem that has plagued it since the beginning: The combat has no sense of impact or energy. You face hordes of enemies that mimic the experience of waving a feather duster at bad actors who were directed to jump back as they see the feather duster waved at them. They fade in, get subjected to a plastic-on-plastic whacking noise, then fade out. They either don\u2019t react at all to being hit or go flying out of range with most of their health remaining.\n\nSecondly, every enemy in the horde will focus fire whichever character you control. This means that when the game gets more difficult, most of your activity will be evading multiple rushes/projectiles while your AI teammates whittle down enemies with minimal use of weakness exploiting mechanics. Combine this with tedious health bars on bosses, and your worst enemy in most encounters will be your own patience. I found myself pounding potions and face-tanking bosses just to get it over with. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if more modern teams like Platinum Games or Team Ninja wouldn\u2019t do a better job translating Persona from turn-based to action combat.\n\nSo, Persona is known for its story! Let\u2019s look at that. It appears as if the developers of P5S were given the impossible task of writing a story that didn\u2019t spoil Persona 5 and consequentially avoids any character development of the original cast. In this respect, it\u2019s as annoying as any fan faction. \u201cHey! Remember how impulsive Ryuji is?! Remember that Morgana hates being a cat and continues to simp for Ann [spoiler]despite learning that he has never been human and is a wizard\u2019s familiar in the form of a cat[/spoiler]?! Remember how Futaba loves to reference video games?!!?!?\u201d That\u2019s right, just lean into one dimension of each character. That\u2019s fan fiction done right! And typical of the most annoying parts of Persona, they often add too much dialogue such as, \u201cAwesome we unlocked this door! Now we can get further in!\u201d Wow, no kidding? Thanks for the commentary, especially when we have twenty lines of dialogue explaining the most obvious puzzles in gaming. A moveable crate to access a high elevation? We\u2019re going to need two cut scenes to explain this never-seen-before game mechanic.\n\nAll respect to Zenkichi, though, he\u2019s well-written, but let\u2019s get into Sophia, the AI, that after leaving the metaverse, gets unrestricted access to the internet. The internet, unrestricted, meaning she can see all the tourism videos, all of Shakespeare, all of Dostoyevsky, every dictionary in every language, then two lines later asks, \u201cWhat does that word mean?\u201d, then proceeds to act like a na\u00efve child through the entire game, trapped in a smartphone connected to the internet, asking to be dipped into the ocean to learn about fish? Why are they falling for this hot garbage? Why are you? Sophia already has access to almost all of the knowledge there is. Atlus, if you wanted her to be a closed-circuit robot, don\u2019t make her an AI. I had to finish the game to see if they redeemed her as a ploy to exploit foolish high schoolers who never wondered for a second why an AI connected to the internet was being asked to be explained and shown things that it could have searched at light speed but left disappointed.\n\nSo, should a Persona 5 fan play it? I don\u2019t know. I personally don't recommend it. The last half felt like a chore. I only finished it so I could see the story to its conclusion because Persona 5 Royal had such a great ending. Persona 5 Strikers did not and is mediocre fan fiction at best. It is fun for a while, though.",

I died a few times because I didn't understand the controls. Definitely would recommend changing key binds.",

Also this game doesn't have a spin-off lobotomy to the characters, they are the same as the main game and have room for some growth still. Very cool\n\nP.S Use Yusuke\n\nCharacter Spoilers: [spoiler]Sophia is awesome and silly and Zenkichi was a surprise hit character and his awakening was unexpected. Also Sophia and Zenkichi are top tier characters[/spoiler] \n\nPost-Game Spoiler: [spoiler]Merciless Mode is a big challenge if your not ready for it, so that's cool[/spoiler]\n",

        "hours": 3953,
        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an amazing game and a great sequel to the original game. It goes further beyond what Atlus achieved with Persona 4 Arena and presents a true continuation of the story in both plot and themes. It is a shorter experience compared to P5 but for some it might be a blessing, but even so it\u2019s still worth every second of your time if you really enjoyed P5.\n\n[h2] Story [/h2] \nFirst off, it\u2019s worth noting that this game requires you to have played through either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. All of the main cast are post-character development so don\u2019t expect any of that here. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that all story additions done in P5R are ignored in this game. That\u2019s because this game and Royal were developed at the same time and since this game is a sequel, I guess Atlus didn\u2019t think enough people would have played Royal within the 4 months in between the two releases. The story is a perfect continuation piece, with every boss connecting to a different member of the Phantom Thieves. You get these moments where the game essentially presents the bad endings of the whole cast through these new enemies and it\u2019s outstanding use of themes of the previous game. Where P5/R was about finding yourself and believing in your ideals regardless of what society believes, this game presents the bosses as people who\u2019ve lost themselves in society\u2019s chains. Their ideals and true selves corrupted to desperately fit in with the rest, creating this parallel with the main cast. Unfortunately the game decides to recreate the last section of the original game in its own way and aside from a key plot twist during this section the rest of it falls flat due to giving a much worse version of P5\u2019s final boss. Imagine the game as one 45~ hour long social link, reuniting with friends and seeing them do the stupidest and funniest things ever.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2] \nIt\u2019s a mix of Warriors gameplay with Persona abilities accessible on the fly. This game is probably the best example of Persona as an Action RPG, as it carries over the Persona abilities with nothing cut. You aren\u2019t restricted to four abilities like in other warriors games, you actually have the full arsenal of abilities and you aren\u2019t restricted to a single persona. Persona summoning is brought back with it functioning the exact same way it does in P5, but the amount of person available this game is severely cut and it\u2019s probably for the best because there isn\u2019t much reason to mix and match here. Bosses are subject to the Persona element system and so are you depending on what Persona is equipped but the way it\u2019s transitioned over into this game is perfect. My only gripe is that because it\u2019s a Warriors game there\u2019s no need to ever use the wide range versions of the element attacks because the regular range is already enough and the sacrifice in attack power isn\u2019t worth it. Being a full-fledged sequel it means that traversal hub worlds are also available here and the new locations look really good. The game also makes a deliberate choice to avoid the locations of Persona 3/4, so don\u2019t expect anything from that. \n\nThe point in all of us is that this game is a must play if you loved Persona 5, hell you\u2019d be doing yourself a disservice avoiding this experience. Even if you think you don\u2019t like the Warriors gameplay, this is very easily one of the most friendly games in the series as it honestly just feels like Persona as an Action RPG. Who wouldn\u2019t want another adventure with the best friend group you could find in gaming.\n",

        "content": "As someone who's an avid enjoyer of Atlus's Persona franchise, despite this spin-off's combat resembling more of a Dynasty Warriors-esque game versus the traditional mainline turn-based RPG style, everything you'd expect from say the Persona 5 base game (excluding social links) is retained here but just executed in a more action-RPG like fashion. Story telling is still superb that's 20+ hours (it's a continuation directly following after Persona 5, but I personally played this game before Persona 5 and was still capable of following along with and enjoying the story), \"palace-like\" dungeons are still present and persona fusions are still in place, but be aware it's just in a different package that may not be for everyone in terms of combat.\nI'd recommend watching a gameplay video beforehand.",

        "content": "[h1]A surprisingly high quality, dedicated sequel to P5 let down by a half-baked narrative and flawed combat[/h1]\n\nLet me be clear that my issues with this game aren't with the change in gameplay style, but for those unaware, unlike the original P5, this game is an Action/Musuo RPG where you mop up hordes of enemies and have access to movement at all times.\n\nCommenting on further changes, the game has.\nNo bonding events[spoiler],at best, there's two scenes where you can pick a person/group to hang out with which is purely up to preference[/spoiler]\nNo Confidants to gain unique passives/abilities\nNo time management, you can enter and exit the new Jails as you please with no repercussions\nAnd no references to P5R.\nNone of these are necessarily negatives, just things to note.\n\n[h1]To be positive before everything else[/h1]\nThe games style is still fantastic!\nDespite not being a new mainline entry, it doesn't feel like they had to sacrifice production values to make the game feels on-par with the original P5.\nI absolutely loved the new characters, they feel like great additions to the main cast and their interactions make me really happy they're around.\nThe new skill/bond tree is a pretty alright replacement for confidants, much less absurd in what it offers, but it's still relatively good progression\nThe music, both new and remixed, is REALLY great, absolutely loved the new battle themes.\nAnd lastly the act of making new Personas is still as satisfying as ever.\n\nBut moving onto the negatives.\n[h1]The story feels like a speedrun of the original P5[/h1]\nA lot of it just feels like a retread of plot points from the original P5, except instead of well over half a year, this is crammed into the span of a month with issues getting resolved on average, within 3 - 5 days.\nThis means that a lot of the plot is typically told to you instead of shown, with the cast just kind of stumbling into problems instead of having them be something that personally affects them.\nThere's definitely more personal issues at points in this story, but I would say you could remove nearly half the Jails and I think the plot would probably be better for it.\nRegardless, for what is there, I feel the villains are rather lacking, even if some of their confrontations with certain characters are pretty well written.\nI may have enjoyed the ending of this adventure, but the actual final act gave me a sense of \"been there, done that\".\n\nMy biggest complaint however is that the combat just never clicked for me, not because it's different, but because of how poorly it mixes with Persona mechanics.\nEnemies are about as mechanically simple as their turn-based counterparts, the problem is that in this gameplay style, you have far more options to damage them and negate damage entirely.\nEven with the most basic interaction of Persona management, you can often find a Persona that lets you negate an enemies attacks entirely, such as negating or absorbing attacks.\nThis sadly extends to bosses which while they're usually far more aggressive than your average enemy, they also usually only have around three moves, and if you bring a Persona that absorbs their element, they might just heal you more than they can physically harm you.\nThe combatants in this game just don't have enough variety to mess you up if you approach them with basic preparation, and I feel that's its biggest misstep.\n\nFurthermore, I would genuinely just recommend avoiding Hard Mode for a first playthrough, while you can most likely handle the absurd damage outputs and healthpools at some point, your companions have no idea how to deal with it.\nA lot of the time they'll just die in one hit, hold onto heals unnecessarily, and overall just feel like more of a hindrance than a help with how many items you'll be pumping into them just to keep them active at points.\n\n[h1]If none of this sounds bad to you, or you just want a continuation of P5, get the game!\nIt's still a quality product that definitely has appeal and it's absolutely not a bad game[/h1]\nI wish I enjoyed this more than I did, but I really do respect the effort that went into this.\nIt absolutely deserves an audience despite my grievances, and I hope this helps.",

        "content": "I've been quite around the block with Persona titles. Persona 3 FES & Portable, Persona 4 Golden, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, Persona 5 Royal, the dancing games, Persona Q, the list goes on. And while its obvious that the mainline Persona games will always be a lot better than the spin offs, that doesn't mean the spin off titles are bad or not worth playing, unfortunately Persona 5 Strikers just isn't one of those titles.\n\nP5S is a spin off of the vanilla Persona 5 storyline as it came out before Royal did in Japan, so no Kasmui or Maruki talk (or even Akechi for some reason) but what really hurts the story in my opinion is the fact the story just isnt as impactful or even as interesting. It feels like you're watching a really long list of filler in an anime you really like but its a 40 hour game instead of 20 or so episodes. It's like if they made a video game of the Infinite Tsukuyomi for all the Naruto Shippuden fans out there. A lot of the dialogue, villains, and even pacing feels like all that, and while its initially refreshing to see the Phantom Thieves return in their glory, the magic fades a lot faster than expected because of this. A lot of the story often repeats itself by doing the same thing after every dungeon is completed, or it straight up reuses ideas from the original Persona 5 game.  Not to say there isn't any funny and cool scenes to look at here or there, but it just isn't enough to save it, especially compared to Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal.\n\n\nAs for the gameplay, they went for a completely different route by using a dynasty warriors beat em up in hordes apporach while using persona mechanics. You can still collect and fuse Personas, cast spells and status aliments, and even the other PT members are fully playable which all sounds really nice except for the fact that the main gameplay doesnt really work as well as you think it does. The dungeons are LONG with really weird and confusing areas as youre climbing, jumping, and running all over the place just trying to figure out where you need to go while shadows try chasing you down. It's really easy to get lost in naviagation because of the weird layout these dungeons have, There's gonna be a lot of \"Oh we're here now but the path is blocked, we're gonna have to find the key to open this block so we can use it, but first we gotta defeat hordes of shadows or protect Futaba while she's hacking in order to get to the other area that has the key we need and then go all the way BACK to open the spot we found originally.\" That's more or less, exactly what you'll be doing in almost every dungeon, especially the later ones. It gets boring after awhile, combine that with the annoyingly long and hard boss fights and the time it takes for you to get used to the layout of the dungeon of where you need to go, this game will soak up a good chunk of your time the first time around. \n\nThe actual dynasty warriors stuff is actually great since they added the persona spice onto it, and I actually enjoy other dynasty warrior games like Hyrule Warriors and One Piece Pirate Warriors for example, which is why I thought I would like Persona 5 Strikers just as much if not more. But those obstacles really get in the way to the point I was playing just so I can see how it ends and finish the game.\n\nAs much as I tried liking and defending this game, I think this is the first Persona game I ended up not really enjoying.  The original Persona 4 Arena story and Persona 4 Dancing stories were pretty boring too, but at least they absolutely killed it with gameplay. While its unique in P5S, it just doesn't save it from the problems it has.  I'd skip on this title unless you're a Persona enthusiast that wants to see everything in every game. I recommend Persona 5 Dancing in Starlight or the upcoming Persona 5 Tactica instead.",

The story is basically a repeat of the original game with sins and each bad guy relating to one of the gang and you only start getting original stuff in the last quarter of the story. The dungeons while having really diverse and fun presentation are all just a big flat field but with new colors every time, maybe that's given in musou games. Most of the tracks are from the original game but the few new ones are also good. The gameplay is fun but except combat there is nothing else to do, no daily management or confidants. It can work for fans and even then it's not a must buy.",

It's not bad, but I dont recommend playing it:\n\nThe first three arcs provided nothing new to what was already seen in persona 5 and felt like filler.\nThe pacing is unbalanced in that the story sections pass by really quickly and break one of the biggest rules in storytelling, \"show, dont tell.\" In other words, a lot of information is told instead of being shown. In contrast, dungeon exploration is long and repetitive. That is partially due to the tedious request system that drags out this already long game much more than it should. (i want my 53 hours back)\n(To those that like persona, be warned that this game has very few social interactions and barely builds upon the phantom thieves as characters)\nthe combat is alright i guess\n\nThe dialogue might be the worst part. The game is filled with scenes of characters standing in a circle doing the same three talking animations, discussing matters you should not be expected to care about as half of the plot events have no stakes involved.\nIts not that big of a deal but it really bothered me seeing the characters perform the same two animations in all the discussion scenes.\nThat being said the game does slowly get better after the first few arcs and had its moments where it truly felt like persona.\nand i must say the soundtrack did not disappoint of course\n\n\nIn summary, not worth your time unless you REALLY enjoyed persona 5. Otherwise, you'd have just as much fun or even more watching a playthrough rather than actually playing it. Either that or wait for a sale.\n\n7/10",

        "content": "Great music, great story, and great gameplay! This is more of a Dynasty Warriors style of gameplay, which I love. This game focuses more on gameplay with a linear story as opposed to the many character interactions and other immersive story and rpg elements in P5 and P5R. There also aren't any romance options. That doesn't mean this is bad game though, it's just a change of pace. On the downside, there aren't as many Personas in this game and no second or third awakenings for the main cast either which is a bit of a letdown. I mean this is a FULL PRICE Persona game. However, the story is still great and I LOVE the gameplay mechanics in this game. Definitely still worth buying though as I still had a sh*t ton of fun!",

I had major stuttering issues but I fixed it with the following:\n\n1) opening task manager\n2) right click on persona 5 strikers\n3) click \"go to details\"\n4) look for \"game.exe\", it will have the P5S logo.\n5) right click on that\n6) set priority to \"high\" (on normal by default)\n7) select \"set affinity\" and check the box for all processors.\n8) you'll have to do this every time (at least I do). \n\nHopefully a future patch fixes the above",

        "content": "The good:\n \n\u2022We get to see the PT again, some members get some much deserved extra screentime\n\n\u2022The new playable characters are very likeable\n\n\u2022Story is decent, it's a bit repetitive at the start but has some good moments\n\n\u2022Music is great, there are new songs as well as remixes from P5\n\n\u2022Gameplay is interesting, similar mechanics to turn-based Persona games, except now it's in (pseudo) real time. Personally it was overwhelming at first but by the end it felt natural\n\nThe mediocre:\n\n\u2022Dungeon design was often pretty boring and sometimes confusing, idk could be a me problem\n\n\u2022Merciless mode (which is ng+ exclusive) is actually hard. No really, breaking the game is a prerequisite\n\n\u2022Fusion system is \"simplified\", which actually makes fusing personas you want a lot more complicated\n\n\u2022Random drops from enemies are stingy and make no sense, I've played for 126 hours and still don't have some very basic \"whatever boost\" skill cards. The drop pools are seemingly so large that farming is a fool's errand. On the bright side you shouldn't really need to farm\n\n\u2022No control for AI companions, can't give them even basic commands like \"Stop spamming heals the moment anyone takes a bit of damage we have 6 million healing items in inventory you're gonna run out of SP and become useless\". Also they suck at dodging certain attacks. Additionally, as far as I've seen, they don't use any special attacks or master arts or anything, which is understandable but still pretty lame\n\nThe bad:\n\n\u2022The difficulty suffers from \"Persona Syndrome\", where the beginning of the game is needlessly difficult and then it gets easier as time goes on as you unlock more skills, level up, get more items, etc. This is especially true in this game; at the beginning on Normal difficulty random mini-bosses will shrug off your attacks and one tap you, but by the end of the game you feel practically unstoppable. This makes the early to mid game a massive slog\n\nThe worst:\n\n\u2022The final boss is just boring on Normal, but on Merciless it's absolutely the worst part of the game hands down. Mashing buttons for 30 mins turns you braindead. You also have to beat the fight 3 times to unlock the secret boss as well, which is not fun at all\n\n\u2022The final boss on Merciless, again\n\n\u2022The final boss on Merciless, but now it's \"painful past +\" so it has even more health, hits harder, faster, etc. Essentially translates to \"takes even more time to kill\"",

It's way to much going on.\n\nAfter looking into this, I see that these people usually make turn based games. I hope they do not make any more hack and slash games because even at $20 this feels like a cheaper indie game that is someone's 4th round draft.\n\nVoice acting and art are very well done. That's not enough to carry this game for me though.",

But rather than simply just being another Warriors-type venture, Persona 5 Strikers feels more like a full-fledged Persona game that happens to have the combat of a Warriors game. There are personas to fuse, access to the Velvet Room, and the classic SMT/Persona spells and weaknesses accounted for. Narratively, P5S is a follow up to Persona 5 and Royal (note: as of writing, have only played base P5, so I cannot comment on how well P5S jives with any changes introduced there), and the plot definitely feels like a true sequel rather than just a mere throwaway story. P5S maintains the flair and style of the original, and the combat is fun and flashy. Overall, a worthy successor to P5.",

I suspect the developers never even bothered to play Persona 3 or 4. just grinding out garbage to make money. no talent or skill put into this game. oh and the music is annoying.",

        "content": "So about half a year after I finished Persona 5 R I finally decided to play Persona 5 S. It took me a bit to finish despite how short the game is compared to the main game, mainly because of Genshin and Honkai Star Rail lol. \n\nP5S was able to replicate the aesthetic that the main game had which is nice, and of course, the music does not disappoint. Even though it reused multiple songs and had reprises of some of the songs from the original game, the few new songs they do add are bangers.\n\nThis game was both really different yet pretty similar to P5R. When it comes to the hack-and-slash part of the game It's pretty fun, especially for casual players, but in terms of difficulty, the game didn't really pose any challenge, especially in the later half of the game, which caused me to lose interest in the game from time to time. \n\nNow when it comes to the story and character interactions, it's really similar to P5R which was the main reason why I was able to finish it. Of course, in my opinion, the story wasn't as great as P5R, but despite that, it was still able to really immerse me in some parts of the game. I also really loved the introduction of both Sophia and Zenkichi, I love them both as characters and find them very charming characters, It was to the point where some scenes involving them really moved me. Also, another thing I liked about the game is that it gave me closure for P5R, just like the ending of P4G.\n\nWould I recommend this game, yes and no, I chose yes on Steam because I personally like it, but there are many things about the game that I can see people dropping or choosing to not play the game over. Also, I do not think this game should be 60 dollars, especially since P5R is also 60 dollars. The game only takes around 30 to 35 hours to finish, there's not that much replayability, and the combat aspect of the game is mostly different from P5R so setting the game at 60 dollars really makes it hard for other P5 fans to justify a purchase like this. Hell, the only reason I got the game was because it was on discount and I was desperate for a Persona game.\n\nAnyway those were my thoughts on the game, very fun, now time to wait for the release of P3R :)",

        "content": "[h1]PSA[/h1]\nThis is not a review, but a warning.\n\nThis game will probably stutter like crazy for you. The solution is to go to Windows Task Manager - Details, then right click and set the game's process to full CPU affinity.\n\nI'm putting this here not only to help potential buyers, but also criticize such blatant disregard for PC port. I am prepared for Koei games to have abysmal PC versions but this takes the cake. The game even starts in a window, for fk's sake... The fact that it's so easy to fix means that devs didn't care at all.\n\n[h1]Initial impressions[/h1]\nI expected a musou game with Persona 5 characters, but this game actually plays a lot more like Persona 5 than I anticipated. Walking around town, talking to NPCs, VN-style cutscenes, equipment, even typical dungeon design - it's all here. It's just the combat that's different. From what I can see - you don't get large maps filled with enemies or forts to capture like in most other modern musou games - you explore a palace like in Persona 5 and when you encounter enemies - you fight an enlarged group of them like in a musou title.\n\nCombat itself is what you'd expect out of a game in this genre. Works well, has it's own spin with persona switching, guns, etc. Makes good use of what we've seen in Persona 5 to create a unique musou experience.\n\nStory is also far more involved than I expected. It's not really a sequel, but calling it a spin-off would be an understatement. It takes place after the events of Persona 5 (but without extra events of Royal edition or it's characters). It introduces completely new additions to Phantom Thieves roster as well as new threats with full-blown anime cutscenes, fully-voiced dialogue and everything you could expect out of a sequel to Persona 5. But if we ever get a sequel to Persona 5, I doubt this would be the story they continue, more likely they would continuoe from the events of Royal.\n\nThen again, it would be very unlike ATLUS to create a proper sequel to a Persona game anyway. Point is - don't treat this like a sequel, but also expect a level of storytelling and quality that's higher than a typical musou spin-off like Fire Emblem Warriors.\n\n[h1]Should you buy it?[/h1]\nI think so. Despite me putting this review at 'not recommended', I have high hopes that it's going to be a great Persona musou game, combining both franchises into a surprisingly strong whole.\n\nBut the way PC ports are treated by Koei is not something I will excuse. If not for the fixable stutter I would recommend this easily. However I may change my mind in the future. If the game ends up being incredibly impressive I may put it on a 'recommended' verdict despite the stutter. We'll see once I'm done with it.",

        "content": "Extremely disappointed with this one. One of the main reasons I loved the Persona games was because of the turn-based combat. Plus, I liked how each game took place across an entire year. This game crams everything into 1 summer vacation which also sucks. It also lags while using a high-end PC which doesn't make any sense. I could play Persona 5 Royal at the highest settings and not have issues. Graphics looks pretty much the same in Strikers sooooo, why the lag?",

        "content": "It's more Persona 5 so if you liked Royal then you'll probably already be playing this anyway.\n\nI like that because the tone of this game's story is less serious than Royal it gives more time to the characters interacting/joking around as a group and there's more social events which I feel was missing a little from PS5R.\n\nOverall the experience is more streamlined with no daily calendar to worry about or social links but is instead all about the dungeons/story. Slightly disappointed some of the social link decisions didn't carry over from PS5R but then Royal didn't reflect completing social links in the main story's dialogue well either.\n\nI liked the new fighting probably more than the turn based stuff in the main game.\n\nThe sidequests are pretty crap and would've liked to see some more social interactions when completing requests for party members instead of just a few lines of dialogue in the menu screen.\n\nDuring dungeons at any checkpoint you can restore the party's HP/SP to full for free by leaving the dungeon and returning to the checkpoint with no expense other than sitting through the loading screens. Time doesn't progress or anything there's literally no reason not to do this so every checkpoint should just be made an auto-heal to full.\n\nThe new characters where good and wasn't too disappointed that characters from Royal where missing.\n\nAlthough the story isn't as good as PS5R I didn't expect it to be and is still interesting enough.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers takes the beloved characters and world of Persona 5 into the realm of musou-style gameplay, and it successfully manages to blend the intense action with the series' signature elements. Developed by P-Studio and Omega Force, this spin-off game offers an engaging and refreshing take on the Persona formula.One of the strongest aspects of the game is its captivating storyline. Persona 5 Strikers takes place a few months after the events of Persona 5, where the Phantom Thieves reunite for a summer road trip across Japan. The narrative delves into the group's inner struggles and their attempt to solve a mysterious supernatural conspiracy that threatens to distort people's desires. The well-written dialogue, character development, and overarching themes of friendship and justice are reminiscent of the original game, making it a worthwhile continuation for fans.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics in Persona 5 Strikers add a new layer of excitement to the series. Combining hack-and-slash combat with role-playing elements, players can control any member of the Phantom Thieves with their unique skills and personas. The battles are fast-paced and exhilarating, with a wide range of enemies and stunning visual effects. Despite the hack-and-slash nature, strategic elements such as exploiting enemy weaknesses and switching characters on the fly still play a vital role, preserving the strategic depth Persona 5 fans love.\n\n,MY RATINGS: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)\n\n",

It is much easier than Persona 5 Royal, but that is fine because it is a completely different type of game. I like the new characters, as well.\n\nThat being said, it does have technical issues. It lacks anti-aliasing, is capped at 60 fps, and crashes often. The crashes can be avoided by using the \"hotfix2\" beta branch and disabling hyperthreading. I am disappointed that it has these issues.\n\nThat being said, it does run just as well on Linux/Steam Deck as it does on Windows via Proton.",

        "content": "P5 Golden was slow to start and overly bloated but it had glipses of goodness and greatness well worth that hundred hours. The combat system was also fun, so while I'd rather fight 10% of the trash mobs it was not onerous. P5S feels like 2nd dev team got the IP, while 1st team was working on something new and their work is significantly worse overall. 30% of people who own this game didn't even go through first hour to 2nd achievement (5% have first achievement so they started the game and played a few minutes) and I had to push myself to try a bit more. Design is worse (just put new characters side by side with originals! It's trash!), story at least for now was worse, I might still persist and give it a shot if combat was any good, but its just not fun.",

        "content": "Wish I could say the fact that Persona 5 Royal completely exceeded my expectations is a factor with how disappointing Persona 5 Strikers turned out to be, but that\u2019s not really the case. I went into it expecting a good mindless hack and slash action RPG with a story that will at least be not bad, yet even that was too much to ask. And while I didn\u2019t hate the title and even occasionally enjoyed it, I\u2019m not sure who the audience for this game is supposed to be.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a curious title. It\u2019s far from the first Persona game to be a story continuation of some kind \u2013 Persona Q, Dancing All Night or Arena games are all considered canon. But it is a direct canonical sequel to Persona 5 (and Royal) to the point where it was marketed as P5 2 in some promotional materials. The title was developed by Omega Force, best known for their Dynasty Warriors games (usually called musou games, from the Japanese title for the series), so it\u2019s a hack and slash with elements of an action RPG instead of a turn-based RPG. While I\u2019ve played and enjoyed only a couple of the Dynasty Warriors titles in the past, I do know that usually their titles are about territory control over big maps with lots and lots of enemies on screen. This game doesn\u2019t play like that.\n\nInstead, Persona 5 Strikers tries to employ an approach closer to how P5 worked. You still have a stealth aspect and an ability to hide and ambush shadows. Shadows are still patrolling the levels in very small numbers only to reveal more of themselves once the battle starts and battles still work as a separate game mode, with a clear boarder you can escape from and a post battle results screen. Locations are also still operating on the Persona logic of certain activities available in the real world and combat taking place in another layer of reality, with several such dungeons available across the game. Magic spells, Persona usage, collection and creation is retained, as are minor aspects of the social life.\n\nBut then the rest of the mechanics are swapped for an action game. Fights are hack and slash and you can juggle dozens of shadows in the air at once. You can jump, have air combos and more movement options. Time management aspect is completely gone and time only advances via story, meaning that you can usually enter and exit dungeons at any point with no downsides. A lot of systems are simplified and the only mechanical aspect of social life is represented via a system of permanent upgrades for you and your team. Every character has their own fighting style and strategy\u2026 Although, you will simply mash buttons most of the time as that\u2019s how these games tend to work.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to have a somewhat mindless hack and slash now and then, but Persona 5 Strikers doesn\u2019t feel that good. I like how you can quickly dash across the battle area and perform cool special attacks, but everything about the combat in the game feels sluggish. Like \u2013 there\u2019s a dedicated dodge button, but it works half the time, often with a delay\u2026 until it decides to works perfectly fine. Or how some contextual actions tied to one single button are usually prioritized in a smart way, except when they misfire and instead of an All out attack you\u2019re suddenly riding a skateboard. I didn\u2019t expect Platinum Games combat, of course, but even Tokyo Xanadu eX+ had a better one and that game is far from being fun.\n\nAll of which then ties to just how dated the design of the game feels. Even Persona 3, for how frustrating some of its design decisions were, feels far friendlier than this title. There are so many pointless loading screens for every little thing. Some side quests require you to talk to a person, then need to go back to your car with a loading screen, accept the request, exit the car with a loading screen, go talk to another person in another location with a loading screen, who gives you another request, so you load back into the car to accept the request, to then go into a dungeon with a loading screen, to then start playing the dungeon with a loading screen or a long cutscene, to then do menial tasks for the request\u2026 And if you think just confirming that you\u2019ve completed said requests requires less steps you\u2019re mistaken. It\u2019s stupid how much stuff is inconvenient in ways I\u2019ve not seen since Playstation 2 days.\n\nThen again, even the audio and visual aspects of the game are such a downgrade. Visually the game isn\u2019t bad, but it doesn\u2019t have that same bold striking vision that P5 has. While the music is\u2026 There are a couple of good new tracks, but the rest are either bland or horrible butt rock arrangements of tracks from P5, that sound as if they were composed and performed by a 50 year old rocker dude who thinks he\u2019s very cool.\n\nThe story is pointless, as in most ways it\u2019s a revisit of the exact same main plot idea from P5, but much worse. New characters aren\u2019t particularly interesting, but that\u2019s not the the issue. The sad thing is that the returning cast feels\u2026 How do I even describe it\u2026 You know how in the 80s and 90s there were TV shows based on movies and they would often have the characters from the movie and same premise, but everything was simplified and every episode had to maintain the status quo and there was no overall story progression? Characters feel like that \u2013 like they were simplified down to their most basic aspects. As if they regressed from who they were at the end of P5 (even if you\u2019ve ignored going through their personal stories). Or here\u2019s another status quo \u2013 the protagonist never tells anyone about the Velvet Room, even though everyone personally experienced it, seemingly just because \u201cthat\u2019s how it was in P5 for the most part\u201d. I know it might be weird to get hung up on the story and characters in a musou game, but it\u2019s also a Persona game. You know, a game with a good story, where personal relationships aren\u2019t just important for said story but are also its defining gameplay mechanic?\n\nSo I simply do not see the audience for this game. It\u2019s not a good hack and slash \u2013 it\u2019s decent enough to be sometimes enjoyable, but not fantastic. The story sucks and feels like an average fanfiction about the characters you grew to like, rather than a sequel. It\u2019s not as stylish or cool sounding as main Persona games. It has no substitute for the fun turn-based aspect of the main game, but is also not mindless and silly enough to be entertaining in the way a Dynasty Warrior game can be. I did finish the game and there were moments where I found myself enjoying the silly spectacle on the screen, but I can\u2019t say that it was worth it. Might be for you, if you find any of what I\u2019ve described alluring. And I do hope to see an action oriented spin-off for Persona someday. Just, maybe do it with Nihon Falcom next time, Atlus. Anything but this.",

I found it hard to get into, but then I dropped the difficulty down, and it made the game a lot more fun because I was really just playing for the story segments and to spend more time with the Phantom Thieves.\n\nThe actual port is really bad. The game didn't run in full screen mode, so I had to play the whole game windowed, which breaks immersion when I can see my desktop.\n\nIn conclusion, kinda jank and the gameplay is not my cup of tea, but the Persona 5 style carries it.",

The story and the vibe are not far from the og and I really love the summer road trip with my best friends. However, the game is not that brilliant as an action game. The game flow is weird, the map design is confusing, the character movements are clumsy, and it has nothing can be really called \"reward\" after each battle...so I can't recommend it to the action game fans if you don't know P5. It is a good addition to the og story though and it makes me happy to live in that world again. Perhaps this alone is enough to put my thumb up for this game.",

        "content": "Persona 5 (Royal Included) sits in my top ten games. This game is like Persona 5, but:\n\n- The gameplay sucks - Braindead mashing and the camera controls are the hardest enemy in the game. Everytime there's a boss the devs' idea of making it a challenge is giving it a stupidly large amount of health.\n- The writing sucks - annoyingly anime tropey at times, although the voice acting is still fantastic, as is every persona game.\n- The new music sucks - unmemorable and the remixes of old songs range from alright to bad.\n\nSo yeah, it's Persona 5 but worse in every way. I'm being very harsh on the game and I'm overselling a lot of the points, but by the 4th jail I was so tired of the gameplay loops and I had to force myself to finish it.\nit fits the definition of a \"mid\" game. Unmemorable, mindless but decent way to pass the time, only recommended if you are a weeb and/or a diehard Persona 5 fan, or you like musou games (which I've never tried before and never will again!)",

        "content": " This is my first Persona game, the characters are interesting enough to make me want to play P5R and P4G. The story isn't exceptionally good or anything, just a fun summer trip with friends but the gameplay is quite solid.\n\n Great soundtrack, didn't understand a world including the english parts. Performance were solid, not a single frame dropped, the UI is a little bit blurry but that's about it. The game isn't hard, enemies are just spongy on higher difficulty unless you can consistently inflict ailments for technical hits, no extra money or exp for playing on higher difficulty. Unless you want to grind, play on normal mode, it's hard to keep the entire team up to your level without grinding much.\n\n The game is surprisingly good for a spin-off especially when the franchise is all about turn-based combat. It's an Action JRPG with Musou combat, not a Musou game with JRPG story elements so don't expect to just spam combos to win like a Musou game. You have to use Persona skills and combos that end with a persona attack to exploit enemy weaknesses to break enemy shields so you can perform an All Out Attack which is your highest single attack damage.\n The time pause when you bring up Persona menu or using gun so use that to reposition yourself during combat because this game is quite a visual clutter, for the first 2 jails I couldn't understand what was happening on the screen. The first 2 Jails gonna be a bit tough because you don't have a lot of SP or recovery items, you can leave jail at any checkpoints to recover HP & SP for free as well as refresh shop's stocks.\n You can play as any characters in the party but everyone only has one persona except for MC, Joker. Different weapons and movesets for everyone, you'll be playing with a party of 5 but one character will always be in your party but unplayable so you'll have Joker and 3 other characters to switch during combat, you can switch party members at any time as long as you're not in combat. Would have been nice if there were custom strategy for AI companions like Tales of Arise.\n You get new persona by either getting a mask drop from killing personas or through fusion, some personas can only be acquired through fusion, when you fuse personas the new persona can inherit up to 5 skills from the parents. You can spend hours trying to figure out how to pass skills that you wanted to your favorite persona, which was quite fun for me or you can just follow a guide.\n New weapons, armors and accessories are locked behind progress, some come from chests or side quests. On certain days during the story you will get new side quests in form of requests, most of them are kill enemies by exploiting their weakness, run to a location without triggering the alarm, collecting junks, refight bosses, fuse a persona to have a specific skill, find an item in jails. Some requests take place in real world, provide interactions between characters and are missable.\n\n Overall the game is solid, I enjoyed it, the first jail is a bit rough but once you get passed it the game become a bit easier, nothing much to complain really except for one achievement that will stop you from 100% the game because it require a stupid amount of grinds for bond experiences, like 15-20 hours just to get the last 30 levels. If you don't care about achievements then the game is one smooth 50-70 hours experience.\n \n",

Even stranger sometimes it runs perfectly while other times being insanely laggy, I have tried everything to fix it, including process lasso but unfortunately nothing has worked. This was very dissapointing since I very much enjoyed the last game.\n\nEdit: The lag has severely decreased, the ping still drops every once in a while but its still playable and no more crashing. Im not sure if there was some kind of shadow update that fixed this but regardless first Jail was amazing, unlike, palaces we actually get to learn about the ruler. The combat takes some getting used to but it still has all the right elements that make it persona. Team combos, striking weaknesses, genius strategies. In fact its even more strategic since status affects can actually work on major bosses.",

I don't think it's perfect, both narrative and gameplay need a lot of polish. But I'd be lying if I said didn't find this game fun. It is definitely not a typical persona game but it's far from a bad one. However, it just means you might either really like it or really don't. But for me, I enjoyed it and I recommend it especially if you like the P5 cast as much as I do. #Ryuji4Life",

        "content": "P5 and P5R are one of my all time favorite games, so of course i got this and quite like it. Story's pretty good, not as thematic as P5 but nonetheless an engaging second outing for the Phantom Thieves. combats fun but a bit tedious. dungeons are cool thematically but overlong and devoid of puzzle-solving. figuring out how to trigger elemental attacks without SP is a gamechanger, and im super pleased with the variety each character has in playstyle; Joker is a bit of a Jack of all Trades, just as he should be, Ryuji and Haru are heavies (both have different combos), Yusuke and newcomer Zenkichi are basically DPS, and Morgana and Makoto are basically healers/buffs. Each character has their own combos inspired by their elements and weapons of choice (Ann imbues her whip with fire, Haru does a spin attack with her axe, etc) and each with also expand by using them--as each character gets used in combat, they unlock more powerful combos. Follow-Ups from P5 return in slightly a different way: when an enemy is staggered, you can switch to the prompted character to trigger a powerful follow-up attack. The baton pass mechanic has also been reworked into an instant switch to active character, so at anytime, you can switch to a character that may better suit the circumstances. A \"Showtime\" attack can be activated once a meter has been filled to either deal heavy damage or clear a room. Each character has their own unique animation for these. Bosses are proper hard, necessitating teamwork and frequent switching, clever use of Showtime, as well as engagement with the dodging and weakness mechanics--this is a very different game from the Persona series' usual turn based MO.\n\nThe story starts really strong and kinda peters out. At first, you may be given the impression that its retreading the personal themes of each thief to further flesh out their character (the first villain relates to Ann, second Yusuke, third Haru) but it drops this seemingly to get on with the actual plot of whose behind it all. Newcomer Sofie/Sofia is charming and helpful as an AI character (which also allows Futaba to shine a little) and is a decently worthy addition to the crew. some noteworthy early absences feel baffling (why are both Iwai AND Takemi not in their usual spots? Not to mention Sumire, but tbf this is a sequel to P5, not P5R) as well as a few missed opportunities to have fun cameos from others admittedly kinda drag it down.\n\nMy one major complaint comes down to the Covid pandemic; this game's voice acting was recorded remotely. While each actor is better and more comfortable as their characters and the acting is generally great, the mixing is not. even after fiddling with the audio, i haven't found a set of options that makes the music and dialogue feel like they have the right volumes. other than that, its a bit tedious, but if you like the characters, its basically a no brainer.",

        "content": "Alright, so for starters, the game is amazing, the new Fighting animations and Designs and Inclusing the story are good, they are like a MOB WAVE Game and each charcter have their own unique animation, i love the yo yo Sophia Moves, but anyways imma head into the main issue. the crashes now i gave up on the game after doing the second Jail. i had over 10 crashes, legit coulndt understand why the crash keep going, i lowered the entire game settings to the lowest, and even turned off discord and 1 other background app and guess what? the crashes countinued. i wont lie, but every time the game crashed, it either crashed when they went into the Metaverse, or a cutscene was changing, i keept crashing after the end scenes for the second Monarch, and i decided to just finish this ark and leave the game for good, i couldnt fixe it, i tried going thru forums, reddit, and even yt videos to fixe the damm crashes, but no prevail. i gave up on this game for now until i get either a better PC or get a way to fixe it to lower the crash rate, but lets see, from 36H game, you only play around 45 minutes before u crash, the game run fine while fighting, but exactly when u head into the metaverse u legit either crash, or just freeze. \ni reccommend this game if u can handle it and the crashes dont effect you, but for me, i dont really reccomend it if you want 78% of your play time being crash after crash after crash, and trust me, having no save point hacks or mod will legit ruin your experience caus emost of the time your in a cutscene and cant save and you either dont crash, or legit crash and losing 78% of progress so yup, big hold in one of these good persona games. thanks for reading",

The change from all out warfare in a big map to repeated encounters of varying difficulty on segmented maps fits the Persona series well. It starts really strong with a visually lush and detailed rendition of fantasy Shibuya but all the further locations aren't as impressive to look at. I would've liked it if we could deploy all the characters in combat instead to being limited to a team of four. It's nice how the plot develops some characters more than the crumbs they got in Persona 5. Play it if you don't mind long games.",

The characters and palaces all feel so comforting and the palaces difficulty are just right at your skill level. Even though they have some music from P5 they remixed last surprise AND added new battle tracks and its a fucking master piece. I wouldnt say its worth the price but on sale its a must-have. The ending is so fitting and is a perfect conclusion to the game. This is now one of my favourite RPGS ever, props to ATLUS for working on an amazing game.",

The only thing I'd complain about in this game will be the awful camera movement. Other than this, everything in this game is amazing. The new soundtrack is absolute bangers as well.\n\nZenkichi and Sophia are great additions to the game, loved how they played their part in the story. The story is also filled with memorable events that were wholesome, goofy, awkward and fun. And the best part, THEY GAVE HARU MORE SCREENTIME IN THE GAME!\n\nOverall, it's an amazing sequel that I'll forever cherish in my memories, just as I loved Persona 5 Royal. I adore this franchise with all my heart so maybe I'm biased so yeah.\n\n10/10!",

Speaking of story, this game kinda has the same story beats, for example, (SPOILERS AHEAD FOR PERSONA 5 STRIKERS AND PERSONA 5/P5 ROYAL) [spoiler]the first palace (or cage as this game calls them) is themed around the deadly sin of lust, and takes place at Shujin Academy. The second palace is themed around vanity and the owner is a famous person that many people hold in high regard.[/spoiler] however, with all that said, I do think that this is overall a pretty good spin on the Persona 5 universe but you should probably only buy it when it's on sale, just to be safe.",

        "content": "Alright funny hehe haha persona game sequel. TLDR? Good Luck.\nMy interest in the game itself? Pretty okay mostly because I love Persona 5 on its own. (including royal because more story stuff.) Im very interested in the combat on its own, especially since you can use abilities without well. Spending resources if you use your combos right. It can get wild. The art style and the looks like usual are just great. Still some things stick out that arent as unique when compared to Persona 5 but still good. \n\nMy problems with the game right now? It is INCREDIBLY difficult to actually PLAY the game. At least for me, im seeing this same problem with other people on higher end rigs. Mines not really high end at all. However I was able to run Persona 5 Royal on max, never had a single frame drop to my memory. \nYou are ABLE to run the game max setting without issues absolutely. The problem, is the game is Horribly optimized. The control scheme is written by monkeys on typewriters mans. (I genuinely rebinded all I could to play like dark souls and it was working better than the default.) \nMore on the optimization issues. Running the game in Windowed, Borderless, or Fullscreen Ive continuously ran into the same problems. (Even with running Process Lasso in the background as suggested online.) The game will drastically drop all the way down to running at 5-10 frames. With Process Lasso running the frame rate doesnt really drop often? But the game Slows Down as if it WERE running at that framerate mentioned above. \nThis can happen with any scene transitions, cutscenes, Pre-Rendered cutscenes, and practically anything you can do in the game. Including Showtimes! in combat. \nIve only put 3.5 hours as of this review and have barely made any progress. Its a serious struggle to enjoy it in this state. Please fix this port. \nIll be leaving it as a No until either I can find an option to fix these issues, or the game gets fixed by any amount. \nOh yeah, the camera is also terrible.\n",

        "content": "tl;dr: beat up monsters for the equivalent of 5 USD and spend it all on food and soda to heal your party hee-ho\n\nStrikers is my first musou/hack n' slash game, I decided to pick this up after finishing P5R. I don't hate it. Sure, feels a bit tedious and the story is not nearly as good as in the mainline titles, but it's actually quite fun beating up crowds of bozos when you get into it. Boss fights aren't a breeze on Normal, but they aren't too difficult or unfair from my experience. The game kind of drags out the tutorials through the first Jail, but I don't mind it as a newcomer to the genre. \n\nIf you are expecting all the Persona-related systems to be fleshed out, I'm sorry. Fusion is terribly neutered and I don't bother messing with it very much. Most of the items you buy are going to be healing items for your team as they get bodied by boss fights. The main draw is the combat, and if you're a player who enjoys time management and day to day life within the world, you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt's definitely extremely linear and doesn't seem to have much meaningful replayability. But so far, I've logged about 12 hours on my save and I'm pretty sure I'm only half way through the game, so there's still plenty of value-for-money to be had here. If you're a Persona 5 fan then you'll at least like the character interactions outside of the gameplay. \n\nIf you're looking for something to hold you over until Persona 3 Reload or Persona 6 arrives, this ain't a bad time investment.\n\nsomething something hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho hee-ho",

Buy up healing and SP items every time you go out of jail\n- Get the shop bond skill early, 60% off bandages will help a lot\n- You can trigger elemental attacks without using SP by using a specific combo (light - light - light - heavy for most characters, some characters just need 2 lights before the heavy)",

In many ways it enhances the characters beyond the base P5. The gameplay is also super engaging if you enjoy managing a party that mows down hordes of enemies in a short time. Although at times if you don't scale in power correctly you can be in this abyss of not being weak enough to die but not strong enough to kill the boss in an effective manner leading to boss fights that feel like they are 30 mins even with no phase changes. Overall huge recommend if you loved the story of P5, although the story takes a minute to pick up.",

        "content": "If you are playing on a PC with an AMD processor that uses simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) make sure you download Ryzen Master and disable SMT when you play this game. It seems to prevent the menu freezes that people have experienced. \n\nI spent over 2 weeks going back and forth with a customer service rep from Sega support about the issue, which didn't result in any helpful information whatsoever. I was able to finish the game using this fix at least and I wouldn't expect a new patch.\n\nAs for the game itself, I would highly recommend it for fans of Persona 5. Definitely play P5R first though.\n\nJust know going in that this is mostly a pretty standard action RPG. I was expecting Persona 5 Dynasty Warriors and it doesn't really feel like either of those games in terms of the core gameplay.\n\nThe day-to-day life sim elements of P5R are mostly gone, but there is still plenty of the classic fun interaction between the characters (except Yoshizawa & Akechi I guess, booo). Many of the other features that you'd expect from Persona are there, like persona fusion, just in a similarly stripped-down fashion.\n\nDespite not being a full-on Persona entry, Strikers is still a lot of fun. If you want more Phantom Thieves, definitely give this one a try.",

        "content": "Summary: If you love the Persona series but wish it was less turn based and more live action, this game is for you.\n\nGASH review (Gameplay, Achievements, Story, Hate)\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nI absolutely love the gameplay. Some may say it's basically another musou game, but I disagree strongly. There is so much respect to the Persona series gameplay that it essentially feels like the devs just took that and added a musou twist, rather than a musou game with Persona sprinkled in. \nTo really succeed, you need to have strong personas and can't simply treat it as a beat-em-up. You have elemental weaknesses/strengths, almighty damage, critical stun states for stronger enemies, and basically everything in mainline Persona games including persona fusion/execution to make your personas stronger. \nThe usage of personas is extremely fluid, allowing the player to choose a persona using a semi-paused popup menu and executing attacks based on what combo you use. Overall, great gameplay and feels like the expected quality of a mainline game.\n\n[b]Achievements[/b]\nThere's nothing particularly noteworthy of the achievements, and if there were any that were painful, I don't really remember them, indicating that even difficult/tedious ones weren't that bad.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story is somewhat lacking but still holds water. It feels like they took a sequel plot to Persona 5 and watered it down. However, the new character is absolutely charming and adds so much to the story by virtue of being such a great character, but I wish the game could've had a story as deep as the mainline game. What it does instead is take a very light approach, which is acceptable considering it's enough to keep your attention, putting the gameplay first and foremost.\n\n[b]Hate[/b]\nThere's not much to actually hate about this game, and I really implore anyone to buy it even if it's not on sale. I wish there was more story, more to be explored, and just more overall, but the experience was absolutely worth every penny.\n",

        "content": "This is a great continuation of a fantastic story. While it came out before Persona 5 Royal and thus none of that version's content is mentioned, It continues the story in typical Persona 5 fashion ... except now it's an action RPG, and it lacks all the confidants and life sim elements you might expect from the series. This makes it a much faster journey, but one which is still absolutely worth undertaking. The music might even be better than the Persona 5, and the story, though more light-hearted does a great job expanding the Phantom Theves' powers. So if you enjoyed these characters and want to see where they go next, absolutely give this a try.",

The music is great, and while I was initially worried I wouldn't like the new playstyle, I got used to it quickly and found a lot of the new mechanics to be really fun! As usual, the storyline is excellent, with some brand new characters I got quite attached to and some twists I did not expect. The boss fight was awesome and challenging. Also, Ryuji finally gets to say \"f*ck\" as a voiced line, so there's that. My only gripe is that I wish it was longer, but at the same time, the game makes it seem like it's going to end a lot earlier than it does and then goes on for a bit longer.",

It's missing some characters I liked in the previous game (no mention of the events of Royal here, including Yoshizawa and Maruki), but the story doesn't suffer from their absence. Check it out if you can. PS: I saw a bunch of reviews talking about glitches and such. I personally didn't experience glitches or slowdowns, although the complete change in controls from Royal did throw me off, and sometimes detection was wonky (at one point I had a hell of a time ambushing an enemy because the reticule kept pointing me at another Phantom Dash target, ugh).",

The gameplay was about what I expected but I do admire how the team managed to translate the megaten/persona fusion system into the game in such a faithful, albeit understandably stripped back, way. The story however is where the game really shines and it manages to build off the themes of the original game while maintaining a breezy road trip narrative. If you loved P5 and have been craving another episode then Strikers really is worth a look.",

And played it after finishing the original game.\n\nIn short, Strikers takes after the events of Persona 5 and brings the team back together in a new case, against a new foe, in a new mystery, which takes them all across Japan.\n\nI just finished it and now it really is over. As the credit roll, I am brought back to all of the moments in the original and in this one that I have enjoyed over 250 hours.\n\n\u540d\u6b8b\u60dc\u3057\u3044\n\n\nIs it worth it? The games is more of a Dynasty Warriors type game with many elements of the Persona games. It is not turn based and is more live action.\n\nOther than that, if you loved Persona 5 and its characters, then this game is definitely worth it and is quite fleshed out, especially for a Persona 5 spin-off game. The game provides massive amounts of fan service as well as general knowledge about Japan and its different regions.\n\nSome tips: Don't let the first part of the game turn you off, it does get better and easier from then. I finished the game on hard mode.",

        "content": "I held out on this for a long time, due to thinking it was just a spin-off capitalizing on the popularity of Persona 5. I was simply not interested in a Musou game (think, Dynasty Warriors) since that style of gameplay seemed too grindy and repetitive, and if it wasn't going to be a JRPG then why bother.\n\nI'm so glad I finally played it.\nLet me make one thing straight: it did _not_ make a believer out of me when it comes to Musou games. In fact, I played this on Easy difficulty to reduce the grind.\nBut, it was absolutely worth it. The story is a direct continuation from Persona 5, and it brings all the style and themes from the orginal, including the grandiose Palaces (called \"Jails\" here), a fantastic soundtrack of both remixes and new songs, and all the crew from the original game. Some new characters are also introduced and they mesh very well with the old cast, which have grown so comfortable with their company to the point where lots of hilarious shenanigans take place on a regular basis. Together with the new well-written story, it was an absolute blast.\nYes, the game feels a bit like it lacks polish or there have been corners cut here and there compared to the full package that was Persona 5, but honestly you won't mind it if you're mainly here for the story.\n\nIf you completed and loved Persona 5, you should definitely get this. If you're not a fan of Musou games, play it on easy and just enjoy the story and spectacle. It's worth it, and the game goes on decent sales from time to time too so you can snag it for cheap if you want.",

        "content": "As a musou game, it's a disaster. As a Persona game, it's also a disaster. God, I didn't have high expectations for this game, but somehow they managed to make me hate it outright. You know, you don't have to fill a game with mini-bosses and bosses with absurd amounts of HP. Even if you play as the game tells you, you're stuck in a boss fight with the same boring, unresponsive combat that has ever graced this genre. It's just awful. The dodge mechanic might as well not exist; what's the point if you're not going to add something to make us actually use it? The punishment is way too high if you miss it, with no real rewards for dodging perfectly. And what's with the ridiculously high amount of damage the mobs do compared to the damage you do? Even when applying debuffs to the enemy, you can barely notice that you're doing damage. It's so weird that the only thing that actually does some damage are your personas, but here's the catch: they have so little SP that by the time you manage to lower 10% of the boss's health, you'll just get absolutely drained of SP.\n\nAnd what's with the world in this game? I just can't understand how we went from a great introductory palace like Kamoshida's to a really dry, generic, and soulless half-baked \"city\". Almost every part of that first jail looks so bland and uninspired.\n\nI won't even talk about the voice acting; it's mostly due to the awful job from the mixing team not doing their jobs properly. Morgana's voice is way too loud in comparison to Yusuke's, and it's just baffling. Again, good job to the voice actors, it's a shame they got let down by the audio mixing team.\n\nThe game difficulty might be too hard even for newcomers, even on easy mode, I presume. Anyway, I just can't recommend this game. Just stick to P5R. Even though it's a JRPG, you'll probably have more fun than whatever they tried to cook up with this one.",

This is likely due to Denuvo DRM embedded in the game but customer support has been of no help and says that \"Unfortunately since the game has not been tested on newer gens we cannot guarantee that you will not encounter these type of issues\". \nThe game has not gotten an update in 2 years even though there is a discussion board (made by Atlus themselves) with more than 1.864 comments about issues with the game (https://steamcommunity.com/app/1382330/discussions/0/3118150513192496504/?ctp=125)\n\nThe game also stutters a lot even when played on a 8th gen cpu which I can only assume is due to shader compilation.\n\nOn Steam Deck using proton 7 or 8 the game will not boot.\nIt should be noted that on Steam Deck with proton-ge50 (modified Valve's proton) this game is playable but the video cutscenes have no dialogue audio which is very important in a Persona game like this one....\n\nTo sum up this game is not worth the technical hassle/bad performance and not even close to being worth the 60 euro price tag.",

Most Persona 5 players might like it.\nI have liked what i played till now and this game feels right at home after playing Persona 5.\n\nEdit:\nHere is a tip for users, with \"stuttering and lag\" issues, who are using intel 12th and 13th gen cpu or any future cpus that has big and little cores.\nUse Process lasso to set affinity of the game to all available cores (P and E cores).\nYou can do this even in process manager of windows.\nIf you need more tips go to the game steam forums and type process lasso for more details and discussion on this topic.",

        "content": "The Good: I think this is the only Persona spinoff I've played where everyone actually feels in character without having their quirks philanderized, and the music is fantastic as always. My desire to keep playing is being fuelled by these things and the plot, which is intriguing enough so far.\n\nThe Bad: Gameplay could have used another pass or two in my opinion. The core action is fine, but the compulsion to cram every mechanic from the main series in here makes for about 10 subsystems too many. The tutorials (while exhaustive) throw pretty much everything at once at you. There's no way (for me) to keep it all straight so I typically end up cruising on the basics instead of getting fancy like the game clearly wants me to do (also I'm 10hrs in and haven't really felt the need to fuse personas at all???).\n\nEDIT: Depending on the day, it also runs like an epileptic tortoise. I've been running it in windowed mode since the start of the 2nd dungeon which helps a bit, but given that loads of people are having similar problems, I'd definitely take this into consideration before buying.",

It's a Warriors game through and through as far as the combat is concerned. And I really don't vibe with Warriors games. \n\nIf you don't mind that, go for it. Story seems nice. But if you also don't like Warriors games, reconsider carefully.\n\nAlso, the fact that there is no punishment to just leave mementos to get a full heal is a big issue. It should just heal you by interracting with the checkpoint/teleporter. At this stage, you spend several minutes every time you reach a checkpoint just to teleport out and back in. With several unskippable transitions and loading screens. It's a pain.\n\nIt's also a pain to run, but you'll find a fix for that down below.\n\n\n\n!FIX TO PLAY THIS GAME ON MODERN HARDWARE!\n\n\nBig ups to NoobMasterB in the comments here. The port is god awful for any decent CPU released the last 5 years. Essentially unplayable. However, using a program called \"Process Lasso\" lets you run the game without issue :)\n\nAnother tip: The game for some reason only has 8 directional movement, even with a controller. Super awkward. For this you can use a mod called \"Smooth Analog Movement\". You get it from Gamebanana. Fixes this issue as well. \n\nAll of this shouldn't be neccessary, but it is. This is a hackjob of a port. But with the above, you will be able to run it nicely.",

        "content": "(very, very mild spoilers. People might miss them completely)\n\n4.5/10 game review, done about 1/4-1/2 the way through the game\n\nGame Play: 3 (controls messy out of the box, camera can be janky), game balance is whacked\nGame Mechanics: 4 ( a good nod to the original but it clashes with the main theme of the combat and it lacks 'soul')\nGraphics: 7 (good, true to original)\nSound/Dub: 7 (good, true to original)\nPlot: 5 (neither good nor bad, little reference to original but doesn't mess with it either)\n\nFor some reason, some of the cut scenes lag. I suspect a porting problem.\n\nCombat is odd. Do you like kicking puppies? Be prepared to kick puppies dozens at a time, because that's the feeling I get taking on a million trash mobs that are no threat with so much happening on the screen that hardly matters, so my brain shuts down and I don't much care. I get this is a type a brand of game on it's own, but it doesn't seem interesting or well done.\n\nThe story does make references back to P5 in a fashion. Slight ones. After all, we know the police aren't fond of joker because of the whole \"No we are the Power and you will BOW to our Awe-Thor-itay because if you don't Society will CRUMBLE\" mindset the japanese have as an excuse for their brand of fascist government and law enforcement (99% conviction rates in court, that's some bull). Heaven forbid there be a hero anyone else look up to that's not them, or anyone else with any real power.\n\nThey added the cute little ballerina, a twisted character I didn't approve of but came to enjoy in PS5R. Then replaced her with an AI in this game. Disappointed.\n\nIt has been done in a way that doesn't mess with the original, lets you go back and enjoy some nostalgia and a different type of game play. I still greatly prefer the original. Dubbing/voices, and artwork are a great match for the original at least, and characters so far have been true to the source material.\n\nI like being able to main as the other character in game play, but game play differs so much from the original and there's so much 'emptiness' to things like not being able to 'live' in the game and develop relationships naturally like in the other game. Also they did just write some other support characters out, and I miss having them around.\n\nI'd almost have rather had an add on for PS5R, that expanded the phantom theives little den to include interactions and little slice of life stories so that it was like adding one of those story book games or \"choose your own adventure' type books. The 'gameplay' is just janky and I havent figured out how to re key the controls into something sane that doesnt annoy me yet. TBH this is a game for either die hard fans or people clueless about PS5 that just like mind numbing mass slasher games. I feel something like Soul Worker or Diablo clones and hybrids would make people happier than this.",

        "content": "The Phantom Thieves are back! This is basically Persona 5 Part 2. Takes place a few months after the events of the Persona 5.\n\nThis game is not a turned based RPG like most of the other Persona games, instead it is a an action hack and slash JRPG. It takes a little getting use to, especially if you just played Persona 5, but I think it works well overall.\n\nThe cast and characters are like your old buddies you got to know in the previous game and still has that certain charm about it.\n\nIt's much shorter than Persona 5 at roughly half the play time, but I do feel that they cut out a lot of the useless time wasting stuff from Persona 5 and really streamlined the game. So overall I think this is fine.\n\nIt's not too difficult on normal difficulty and I think most players should easily be able to beat the game on that setting.\n\nOnly real complaint is on a 12 Gen Intel chip the game does not run correctly. I needed to change the game to run as high priority on my processor in order to stop the game from stuttering like crazy. Some people might run into this issue, in this case I recommend using a program like Process Lasso to set the game to always run with high priority.",

        "content": "(NO SPOILER REVIEW)\n\nAfter completing the story playing New Game Plus on Merciless Difficulty and attaining all the achievements on the game i could clearly say that this has to be one of the greatest sequel games I have played so far. \n\nComing out of playing Persona 5 Royal -> Persona 4 Golden -> Persona 3 Portable & FES this game felt like a breath of fresh air.\nGoing back to Shibuya as Joker seeing how the other phantom thieves are doing in life really felt like meeting your old friends again back in the day. And thats where this game shines it takes all of whats in persona 5s story and world building and adds upon it. Using the same rules not breaking it but also adds upon it to the point that it feels natural is one of the greatest ways to make a sequel. Another thing that I enjoyed is the dialogue of each characters every single dialogue didn't feel out of place, every line of each character has meaning, each banter among all of the characters is nothing but entertaining to watch (props to the voice actors as they did a phenomenal job never in my entire life have i heard such great voice acting their performance in P5R was great but this was a major step up). \n\nOverall 10/10 for writing and direction \n\nGameplay wise it is similar to a warriors game but may it not stop you from actually trying the game out the combat is smooth and the combos are satisfying to pull off and are greatly animated. Each character are uniquely made to suite every play style and not one character was ever useless or unplayable. Gameplay loop of smashing buttons is fun as heck.\n\nOverall 10/10 for Gameplay \n\nNow on the the graphics and animation, it may be in a different game engine and was made by a different team but the graphics and animation never fell off furthermore it feels more of an upgrade at times. So in short if you love the original Persona 5 aesthetic you will love it all the same with this game\n\n10/10\n\nNow music. \nIts a no brainer 10/10 \nLynn went ham with the signing remaking most of the songs from the original persona 5 and making them into rock was a move no one expected but everyone enjoyed. From past music to new music everything on this games track was banger after banger never disappoints.\n\nAddition to what i said about the writing of the game all the new characters mesh well with the phantom thieves group and are all well made.\n\nThe only con I have with this game is that after finishing and experiencing it means less persona games i have left until persona 6 or another persona 5 spin off is released.",

        "content": "A short and honest review of PERSONA 5 STRIKERS\n\n\u201cStrikers\u201d has the \u201cPersona 5\u201d (P5) DNA all over it. The Persona universe and P5 characters are nicely used and new memorable faces join the action. It all makes the game feel like a true sequel! The \u201cmusou\u201d action genre works great too, implementing Persona-like elements for even better. Nonetheless, it can get repetitive, so I\u2019d advise playing in short sessions. The only thing I didn\u2019t like -at all- is the \u201cjails\u201d (dungeons) music. It feels off! And left me wishing there was an option to change it, as there is with battle music. Also, no gallery to watch images or cutscenes nor new game+, bummer! In the technical aspect, I had a problem where pre-rendered videos would stutter for the first seconds, delating the game was loading in the background. Also, a crash that costed me hours of progress (no auto-save! Which doesn\u2019t make sense, as the game doesn\u2019t have branching paths or anything alike). That said, I would sincerely recommend \u201cStrikers\u201d to any P5 fan. It will help with the post-game depression the original leaves you with and present new amazing (canon) situations for you to enjoy! Just don\u2019t expect the \u201cdepth\u201d a traditional Persona game can have.",

        "content": "I was really looking forward to having more of the P5 cast, but Strikers is way too unfocused to be enjoyable. \n\nI initially thought Strikers was going to be a more action oriented take on the Persona formula and im aware that it was drawing inspiration from Dynasty Warriors type of games. The movement and combat itself feels very clunky. Mid-PS2 era clunky, those years where devs were still grappling with having a lot more freedom of movement in 3d space and better tech to support it. They also didnt blend mechanics or gameplay styles, theyve simply jammed them into the same area. Imagine a Dynasty Warriors game, but now  take every single mechanic from P5 and layer it on top. It's too much to handle and it doesnt feel good.\n\nThe smaller mob encounters are also over way too fast for you to get comfortable with the combat, which means by the time you get to a boss you have no idea what youre doing. All in all its a very sloppy execution of a cool concept.",

Gameplay wise it takes the Warrior genre and mixes it with stealth and some stratagie you cant just spam buttons and everything dies (well endgame wise you can), my only problems with the fighting is the dodge and its minor problem at that, basically some enemies can combo you into a chain of attacks you cant dodge out of which gets annoying sometimes. plot wise its the persona 5 cast plus AI girl and Dojima but he has longer hair and glasses. the comedie is good and plot is fairly interesting, though word of advice for people who want to play this game but haven't played p5. PLAY PERSONA 5 OR PERSONA 5 ROYAL BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME! if you don't the plot WILL be semi confusing. Any way this game is good, and its worth giving it a try.",

The first palace (jail) can be a bit dreary at first mainly due to sp conservation if you for some reason are doing it in one run. I would highly recommend a Merciless playthrough if you are up to the challenge. That's when you notice spamming combos won't get you far and you need to be strategic with what personas you have. Do note that it will be an unforgiving journey, but honestly it is worth it in my opinion.",

However, the PC port is a stuttering, lag-filled mess, even several years after the steam release. It's playable, but frustrating for an action game. Its combat is also somewhat questionable. It tries to marry the \"ambush and start a fight\" mechanic of a JRPG into a dynasty-warriors-style combat system. The result is squishing a chaotic number of opponents into a tiny combat arena while simultaneously removing the strategic map-management elements normally present in this genre.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the effort at innovation, this just didn't quite work for me. I'd still probably appreciate the overall game if it played better despite disagreeing with some of its design decisions, but no amount of polish in flavor/style can make up for the poor performance of the game itself.",

[list][/list] Following the events of Persona 5, the world somehow manages to find itself facing ruin once again and that likewise means that it's time for the Phantom Thieves of Hearts to be wrongfully accused by the police yet again. [list][/list]  The visuals are great and the music is top-notch as always. The first dungeon's theme song \"Loving Wonderland\" along with \"Welcome to the Jail\" and \"Last Surprise - Scramble\" have to be my favorites so far. [list][/list] Sidenote: I found a girl in a box and now she lives in my phone! [list][/list] Spoiler: [spoiler] One thing about this game that's kinda upsetting is that Sumire and Akechi are absent both in game and in story from what I can tell. Though, I'm sure there are reasons for this given that one is probably at (inter)nationals and the other might be dead or in police custody or something, who knows. [/spoiler] [list][/list] I will most likely be updating this review again once I finish the main story.",

        "content": "This game is a solid sequel to persona 5, and anybody that enjoyed that game should definitely play this one. It can be a little brain dead at points, but the combats pretty fun (for the most part). Every character (except Morgana) has a fun, if just a little too similar move-set I enjoyed playing and learning. I think Makoto, Haru, and Ryuji were my favourites. The road-trip story is solid, and has some great character moments for all of the phantom thieves, except like Morgana or Futaba (rip) from what I remember (Finally, justice for Haru). Most of the new characters are also great. I love Zenkichi SO MUCH. Even outside of all that, Ryuji gets to say fuck, so the game is automatically a 10/10.\n\nHOWEVER\nThe game has some MASSIVE problems.\n\nFirst and foremost, the PC port is absolutely TERRIBLE. The game constantly stutters to the point of being unplayable. Seriously, I couldn't even get past the first goddamn cutscene when I first tried to play. I had to download an external program called process lasso to get the game to even work properly. The game is also capped at 60 FPS, which isn't the biggest deal, but I found it can quite easily drop below that when things get hectic. Even on hardware which far exceeds the recommended specs. While I'm sure it was a pain the the ass recreating Persona 5's trademark look on a completely different engine, the anti-aliasing makes the game look pretty terrible. But luckily, this can be pretty easily fixed with the few settings tweeks. I also got caught in an infinite loading screen at one point, which was is always my FAVOURITE feature in any game.\n\nUnfortunately the problems don't stop with just the poor porting job. While I liked a good amount of the story bosses (final boss excluded), a good amount of them have WAY too much health. I played on hard so I'm not sure how it is on lower difficulties, but I feel like most bosses ended up outstaying their welcome. I remember one of the optional bosses took me about 20 minutes straight to beat, all while having no extra challenge outside of the time commitment. Also, once I figured out spamming the square + square + triangle combo was BY FAR the most efficient way of playing the game, the combat became far less fun for me. Those are my main issues, but there's a few other issues I have with the combat, like all out attacks feel incredibly under powered, and the camera being pretty janky. The side quest also kinda suck, which is pretty disappointing for a franchise like Persona, where the side content has been one of it's major draws since Persona 3.\n\nThe persona fusion system in this game is also a hot pile of ASS. For some god forsaken reason you need to have high level early game persona for some of the later fusion. This would either take millions of yen of buying and deleting high level personas over and over again, or literal HOURS of grinding. I have no clue who approved this change, but they should be very careful on August 17th 2038 at 7:43 AM.\n\nOverall, I still think strikers is a worthwhile sequel to Persona 5, and I would still recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the original. BUT, there are some big problems that hold this game back from being truly great.",

Yes, it is super barebones in comparison but it's actually a good way to get used to the system without getting overwhelmed. Before I played this I had watched playthroughs of Persona 3, Persona 5, and either Persona 4 Golden or Persona 4, so I was used to the mechanics. This was a great intro to the system for me before I got Persona 4 Golden, though to be fair I think Persona 4 Golden is simplier than Persona 5 Royal which overwhelmed me a little my first playthrough. There is one main issue with the steam version I have noticed. It buffers a lot. I'll be playing and my screen freezes or is delayed a ton. Sometimes it works out after I mess with setting, but other times not which is why I haven't put more time into this version when my Switch copy has like thirty or so hours of gameplay. It can't be my computer because Persona 5 Royal and Persona 4 Golden have no issues running on it. Overall a really good game that serves as a fantastic intro to the game series, excluding the whole minor spoilers to Persona 5 part.",

        "content": "Although Persona 5 Strikers had been available on PC for a long time, because [b]just minutes inside this title would be enough to spoil most of Persona 5[/b], I saved it until after I could experience Royal.\n\nCredit is due to the developers for their ability to recreate Persona 5 in a different engine and genre. If I didn't know otherwise, I would have assumed it was the original team behind this spin-off. [b]Every step of the way I could feel the love put into this game.[/b] Starting from the story to gameplay and the new music tracks which will enter my playlists!\n\n[b]The story[/b] of Strikers is a lot simpler and, while captivating, whereas in the original you obtain new companions and help them through their hardships, this is a bit less connected to the main characters of the game. Compared to the original very black-and-white story with clear villains and heroes, Strikers is a morally greyer story with a unique outlook on its villains. \nIt's worth noting that although Strikers is technically a sequel to Persona 5, [b]the events of Royal are never mentioned[/b], but they are not incompatible on a story level.\nAlthough justified, sadly the player doesn't get to keep the powers from the original title.\n\n[b]Gone is the turn-based combat, replaced with a new action-based combat system[/b], and, while it's wildly different genres, the combat feels very familiar.\n[b]The game is a musou[/b], which literally translates to \"unmatched\" and the main focus of this genre is cutting through hundreds of enemies that are nowhere near your level.  Because of my interest in the characters I went into it knowing it was not necessarily my cup of tea. Regardless, I can see it's one of the best musous out there, with all the faults that might come with the genre.\n[b]This makes fighting fun, but repetitive[/b], especially with smaller enemies. Because this game is still a Persona, [b]in-between fights there's a lot of story dialogue demanding your attention after waves and waves of enemies that don't[/b]. This is followed by the very peculiar choice of having the first 3 dungeons of the game be almost copy pasted, only to add some variety towards the end of the game. \n\nWhen it comes to [b]exploration[/b], compared to the other Personas, [b]this is an extremely linear title [/b]that leaves little to no freedom to the player. The gameplay loop consists of going through cutscenes or braindedly cutting through waves of enemies when exploring a dungeon that often follows a very specific progression pattern. Rarely it's possible to explore the city and move freely, which is really just a jog around stores to see if something interesting is for sale. \nWhile the game is more linear, one very positive note compared to the original is that [b]almost all dialogues are dubbed[/b]. Because there were physically fewer dialogues, more could be voice-acted.\n\nThe title suffers a bit from all this repetition in my opinion, but it definitely ramped up in the second half keeping me hooked!\n\nJust like in the original, [b]Requests are back, but[/b] because of the absence of Mementos, [b]it's only fetch quests that instead of adding to the experience, gatekeep abilities and what-not behind their completion.[/b]\n\n[b]The difficulty[/b] was also a weak point for me, because as it often happens in these titles, [b]it's just numbers, making the fights longer instead of more challenging.[/b]\n\nTo me, [b]Strikers was like when your favorite anime releases a filler movie that doesn't really add anything, but it's still more of the thing you like.[/b] It's a delightful, post-main story of the original, adventure with all the characters I grew to love.  \nAfter reading all this, if you're still convinced in getting it, go ahead. The small repetition in gameplay won't wipe out the charm and a story worth the Persona name!\n\n[b]6.5/10[/b]",

        "content": "The combat, music, characters, story, and overall gameplay is extremely enjoyable. The combat is so fun, I want it in future Persona titles. The combat's breathtaking and it's real fun combined with the banger music. However, the game is extremely unoptimized for PCs. The UI elements and texts are extremely blurry (even with anti-aliasing disabled), and it really took me out at the beginning. I got used to it to the point where I could play the game without being too annoyed, but it certainly doesn't feel like enough attention has been put into those aspects of the game, compared to P5R absolutely nailing them, where the game looks gorgeous at every turn. And the performance is pretty inconsistent as well, despite the game being locked to 60fps unlike P5R running flawlessly at 120fps. There are occasional frame drops and stutters, which I don't think should be happening with an i7-12700K and a 3080. And the camera feels weird to control with a mouse (but it's fine with a controller), where it was perfect on P5R with both mouse and a controller, which makes me think they just upscaled the Switch version of the game, leading to unoptimized camera and blurry UI elements. The game is still extremely fun nonetheless, it feels like a lot of care has gone into the music and overall gameplay (along with other things I praised), which is ultimately more important than minor optimization issues, but I'd like the issues to be fixed at the same time, so I can truly feel happy and satisfied playing this game :D",

The combat feels more fluid and engaging to me and doesn't burn me out in the same way the turn based combat would, the faster pace is very much welcome for me. Overall, I enjoy the combat more in P5S than the original. It feels very much like P5, though, carrying over every mechanic from that game -- on the combat side of things, anyway.\n\nStory and progression has been streamlined. There's no time management aspect to it anymore, and no social links. \n\nWhaaaat?! But those make Persona games great! Maybe. But I never felt like it was lacking, going through just the story of it. In fact, I appreciated it, because it severely reduced the feeling of *bloat* that was so evident in P5. The pacing is better. But the game is still very dialogue heavy, with some serious moments, emotional moments, and laid back moments, with the crew just hanging out. It was great.\n\nIn other Persona games, I've never really had the urge to go in for a New Game Plus, or post game content, but here - I still have the drive to play, after finishing the story. Much of this is due to the more streamlined nature of the story and progression, but more than that, it's because I find the combat much more enjoyable.",

They managed to implement many features from the previous game in a way that just works in a super satisfying way with the Warriors-style gameplay it has. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up doing every single possible battle challenge the game gave me and I loved all of them.\nIn regards to the story, I generally LOVED seeing the interactions with each other that the Phantom Thieves had during this long trip through the whole country, it gives a lot more depth to their bonds as friends, but... There are some scenes I would do without in it, though. If you have played this game, you'll probably know which ones I'm talking about. \nThe new characters are also really well written and fun, Zenkichi is definitely my favourite in the whole game, honestly.\nI had so much fun with this game that I ended up replaying it all over again on the highest difficulty, and still had a blast with it. It's that good.",

        "content": "This game is a very bizzare mix of P5's original mechanics and a hack n/ slash ARPG style game. \n\nThe core problem that feeds into all the other issues I'm about to mention is that Strikers carries over ALL of the mechanics from P5, including baton passes, skills, elemental affinities, all out attacks, etc. This is way too many mechanics to juggle all at once while fighting enemies in real time. All of that stuff worked in P5 because it was a turn based game. But here, you're fumbling with the controls to desperately do the thing you need to do before you get killed. This process isn't helped by how awkward the control layout is, which to be fair, isn't a design issue, its a result of having so many more key assignments than you'd normally have in an ARPG. Sure, you can reassign them, but that doesn't help with there being way too many RPG-like mechanics in the first place. I suspect no layout could possibly make this mess feel intuitive. \n\nAt the same, the game seems to be critically lacking basic features common to ARPGs: blocking, for instance. I also found out only after dying over and over again that while there is a dodge button, it is too awkward to use reliably (its H, try pressing that repeatedly while keeping your fingers on the standard WASD!) It also doesn't seem to stop the enemies from hitting you with skills, the only way to interrupt them being to down them with their weakness. \n\nWhich isn't a reliable strategy because...you only get enough SP to use skills a few times during each infiltration. Since the red powerful shadow mechanic returns, this basically means you have to avoid those guys entirely. They're minibosses with massive HP sponges that take forever to kill if you can't beat their weakness. And even if you can, it drains all your SP. But don't try saving your SP either, because just sitting there mashing attack will get you killed by their repeated bombardment of undogeable skills before you have a chance to even dent their HP pool. Using non-weakness breaking skills also doesn't help, since they barely do enough damage to dent their HP pool either. \n\nSo what you get at the end of all of this is a system that combines the worst of both worlds. You have the really shallow elemental weakness system that makes fights a cakewalk if you have the right skill, and impossible if you don't. You have to manage it at high speed while fighting in real time, but no simplified moveset that compliments this speed. \n\nYou could try to coast by using the gun and basic attack, but those are really the only ARPG elements and they aren't very effective or deep because the bulk of the game is balanced around the RPG stuff carried over from P5. For instance, all you're really doing if you're not using skills is literally just mashing left mouse button over and over again. There is no timing mechanic, or having to vary your attacks, parry, etc...in other words, the basic fundamentals of an ARPG. Its all automated. \n\nAlso, the screen is way too visually cluttered to even see what is going on or react to enemies properly. It made me really annoyed with the anime art style because sometimes I couldn't even see when an enemy is \"down\" and open for an all out attack because there were too many ridiculously flashy effects happening on the screen at once.\n\nThe story seems like it could be decent, but without breaking it into segments where you can control what you do each day, the game feels very streamlined and gives the player even less agency. The time management is the main thing that makes Persona games feel sorta like real RPGs in the first place, so without that, I just found myself lacking any kind of investment in the story. \n\nSkip this one. Its a JRPG half-assed into a clunky ARPG that doesn't get the high points of either genre correct, and simply re-hashes the main themes and characters of a much longer game.",

        "content": "I had this game on Switch and absolutely loved it. So when Black Friday rolled about and this game is also on sale, I just have to get it for my Steam Deck. Officially, it's not Steam Deck verified as of yet, but there are some tweaks I did that enabled it playable on Deck, but not without a few technical issues. The audio for one is missing from cutscenes when I play on my Deck. \n\nOtherwise, game runs perfectly fine.\n\nOnto the game, story-wise:\n\nThis is technically a sequel to Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal, so if you hadn't played that game, you would be completely lost on the plot. It revolves around the Phantom Thieves, with it taking place nearly a year after the events of P5/P5R, with Joker returning to the town once more to meet up with his friends, and with Morgana in tow. However, they then stumbled across another alternate verse in a highly popular new app that had been making it's rounds, with certain individuals making use of this alternate verse.\n\nUnlike P5R however, the 'villains' in this sequel aren't outright 'evil people'. They are still misguided individuals, and need a good dose of reality. But honestly, I prefer them a lot more than the villains in P5R. This game is also a very 'coming-of-age game'. If the prequel focuses only on one town and one area, this game actually has the group travelling across Japan.\n\nEssentially a hack and slash game instead of the turn based combat in the previous game, the game still kept the basics of sneaking around and ambushing enemies. Dungeons however are easier than the original.\n\nHoping Valve soon verify the game for Steam Deck though. I really want to play it on my Steam Deck.",

I just felt that from P5R lack those if compared to P3 and P4. The combat is surprisingly good, its a nice change of pace from the usual turn-based combat of the persona series. I can even say its even better than the other series the combat took inspiration of. The only downside to the combat is it has so many effects on screen that may confused you as to what is actually going on. Like this skill effects is from an ally or foe.",

A full playthrough is probably around 35-50 hours active time.]\n\nI absolutely love Persona 5 + Royal and was glad to experience more of the narrative, which wasn't as good as the original with less personal growth among the player characters and less interesting early game villains, but still quite decent. In some sense it was also nice that it was a faster experience. But the combat gameplay just felt so terrible: Slow, cumbersome and frustrating.\n\nIt seems like there might be a lot of depth there if I had engaged more with it, but it just struck me as time consuming and not very worthwhile. I've had an excellent time both in original Persona combat and in fighting games such as Monster Hunter where I've soloed most hardmodes, but here the fighting just seemed very much not worth the effort, and fundamentally incompatible with the deep menu systems and skill usages from the Persona backbone. There were so many abilities and nuances that I'd have cared about in turn-based that just felt unimpactful or a waste of time in this system. For the first time I turned a game to easy and breezed through most of it. That made it a pretty decent visual novel but meant that anything to do with stats, fusions, gear, skills and attributes was pretty much meaningless and left the experience lackluster with major pacing issues. But before I did that, my experience with the game was a great deal worse.",

Characters didn't feel like the ones you got to know from p5, but cheap copies instead. It was very off putting at first. Everything they say feels wrong. Yusuke was the worst when it came to writing. It's obvious that the writers who worked on persona 5 strikers don't understand what made yusuke funny and special. He has 0 moments in this game. He says something autistic then his part is done. \nHad the game been mostly combat and gameplay this wouldn't really matter. But since there is so much talking, it becomes very hard to overlook. \nIf you haven't played persona 5 this is probably a pretty interesting game.\nBut I feel like this game would have been better off not being a persona 5 spin off. The core of the gameplay is fun. The writing could actually work if it the characters weren't already established. \n\nMostly recommend the game for it's combat/systems and end of story moments \n",

I hate real time fighting games. I wanted the classical experience but it turned it was another Persona 5 with the same characters the one that I wanted.

        "content": "Cool spin-off for Persona 5. A nice roadtrip throughout Japan with all your friends to make some more memories and defeat evil gods (again), sadly romance options dont carry over, most characters except the main characters from 5 are missing and no Royal characters/content either.\nNot the biggest fan of the combat either, its action-heavy and fast paced, but I prefer the normal turn-based combat. In this game it sometimes can get very chaotic with the dozens of enemies around you and abilites filling the whole screen, and a lot of the time you just button mash your way through hordes of enemies to victory, other than that its fine.\nThe game and therefore the story itself are shorter than the main game, which is to be expected, but because of that some story beats and especially the (main)antagonists are very surface-level and bland at times.\nThe  music, voice acting and visuals are all up to par with Persona 5 and the game also features some new tracks.",

        "content": "My honest review after clearing the game at 87 hours, not including post game. (1st playthrough)\n\n1. Gameplay\nA wonderful spin-off from the persona series set in the world of persona 5 with a unique twist on the dynasty warriors style. Hack n slash style of gameplay combined with mid fight persona switches and party member tagging. There are also interactable overworld objects that provide cover or grant their own attack options, allowing for different gameplay styles. In addition to persona abilities, all out attack returns and the mechanic of showtime changes up attack combinations and makes for a satisfying playthrough. \n\n2. Story\nEven coming out of Persona 5 Royal with high expectations, Persona 5 Strikers has managed to prove itself to be a worthy sequel in its own right. The journey around Japan on a roadtrip feel so nostalgic and heartwarming. The plot is also a fair continuation to the original Persona 5 with its own twists in its story. As a game focused on battle gameplay and less on story, it manages to do its job well. \n\n3. Characters\nThe return of the Phantom Thieves starts off back at LeBlanc, a heartwarming reunion which brings back memories. The new Phantom Thieves also integrate themselves well into the team, enhancing the story further. The character development arcs of the new characters are great and being able to control each Phantom Thief individually plays perfectly into the immersion. \n\n4. Graphics\nThe overworld is amazing, using the same style as Persona 5 Royal. Each city is different from the next and really takes you on a tour around Japan. The new dungeons are fabulous, each having their own distinct features from those that mimic the real world to fantasy worlds. Attack and movement animations are fluid too. Persona 5 Strikers is without a doubt, visually stunning.\n\n5. Audio\nThe OST in this game is once again, truly phenomenal, I had my doubts that it would come close to Persona 5 Royal, but considering how high the bar is, Strikers has done it. The electric remixes of returning Persona 5 OSTs are fantastic, fitting for the faster game pace of Strikers. Not forgetting the new tracks too, the first Jail's soundtrack was such a hook and made way for all the bangers in the OST, down to the final boss fight. \n\n6. Technical\nGame is bug free and is buttery smooth, not a single crash throughout my playthrough. Load times are short as well.\n\n7. Value\n100% buy, bang for every buck, DLCs included! Even though this style of game isnt my preferred and it took a while to get used to, I loved every bit of it and have 0 regrets. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers offers more replayability compared to Persona 5 Royal and I can't wait to get back in to NG+ after clearing the post game. Fingers crossed that more Phantom Thieves content is on the horizon, as I have come to love the series so much, cmon Atlus make the dream come true.",

        "content": "As spin-offs go Persona Strikers is superb! If anything it comes off more as an expansion pack of old. In other words,it picks off right where P5 left off whilst dealing with similar paranormal,psychological,and societal issues.\n\nAs a musou fan I love the action based combat but in trying to adopt mechanics from P5's systems it excels in certain areas and falters in others. This time you have to be much more aware of enemy weaknesses with certain more formidable foes requiring you break their defenses before you can prod at their soft tender underbellies with your attacks.\n\n Additionally there's a clumsy attempt at \"stealth\" and \"surprise ambushing\" that frankly does not carry over well for this kind of genre. Imagine Devil Mat Cry 5 having aspects of Metal-Gear randomly thrown in just for the heck of it. It would make for a rather disjointed stop and go affair wouldn't it? The same applies with Persona Strikers. \"Fortunately\" future unlockable abilities begin to circumvent this problem and everything else from the exploration to the boss-fights is still platinum mint!\n\nThe story-telling,character interactions,and sound-track also deserve praise with even the new characters fitting in as opposed to sticking out like sore thumbs.\n\nWell,\"mostly\". We finally get an adult persona user thrown into the mix but because he's a cop and initially has ulterior motives the main characters constantly dog on him by calling him gramps. Instead of handling the roasting stoically with a wry smile he whines about it incessantly. You know that meme \"How do you do,fellow kids?\". That's  Zenkichi in a nut-shell! Fortunately he eventually moves beyond this annoying first impression by revealing himself to be a more likable person later on. (Thank goodness)\n\nAs for Sophia? I have no problems with her what so ever. Persona 3 already presented the idea of having artificially intelligent robot companions with Aigis so Sophia being an \"ap\" that can manifest a more physical form in the meta-verse makes perfect sense within this continuity. She manages to be innocent and curious yet learns quickly whilst always being helpful.\n \nI also appreciate how Strikers seems more about helping flawed people towards their personal redemption arcs and forgiving them as opposed to simply pursuing them as the bad guys then destroying their livelihoods. Don't misunderstand me,the antagonists in Strikers are still formidable adversaries. It's just this time we get to see the more positive application of \"stealing hearts\" expanded upon similar to how it was used to save Futaba and Sae Niijima.\n\nYet there is an underlying problem with \"Modern Persona\" that permeates Strikers as well. That being that the mundane socializing aspect which is wonderful for character building also undermines the high stakes of the over all meta-plot.\n\nTo me Persona is still apart of the Mega-Ten/Shin-Megami-Tensei brand. That means gods,goddesses,and other mythological beings are \"real\". There are dark uncaring cosmic forces from neighboring dimensions that creep their tendrils into our world to usher forth Armageddon. The only reason we are still here is because the heroes and heroines in these ongoing titles reset reality every so often to ensure humanity as a whole will continue to survive.\n\nBut hey,gotta go to the bad-bad bathhouse with the boys,amirite? Gotta throw some darts,exchange \"gamur speak\" with Futaba, or sing some karaoke to ensure the fans can  immerse themselves in the \"totes believable\" post-modern-pop-culture setting!  Again,I don't want to come off as a grouch. When I first played through Persona 3 and Persona 4 I really did appreciate the social-bonding system as I grew to truly care about even a few of the more insignificant side-npcs. \"But\" when you go about mundane routines within an environment that is not remotely surreal or remotely frightening the whole \"We're under-dogs fighting scary apocalyptic deities in a cosmic horror setting\" part of the SMT formula is watered down significantly.\n     \nStrikers does not have as much of this normie-simulation-filler as its' predecessor \"but\" there is still a lot of dialogue and down time compared to the typical musou outing. No doubt certain people will appreciate this but others will forget they are fighting with dark-forces from beyond the pale as the road-trip-monotony sets in. Strikers would have benefited from a greater sense of urgency. (Same with P5 as well.)  \n\nNow back to the good news! Persona fusions,leveling up,unlockable bond bonuses,and acquiring increasingly better equipment sets are still present. Better yet,you can take control of EVERY Phantom Thief directly. (Save for Futaba and that's a pity. Oh well. She served as the oracle in P5 so it makes sense she's relegated to the roles of hacking and support! I still see it as a missed opportunity though.)\n\nOf all the spin off Persona games I rate \"Strikers\" as the best one thus far even if the transition from turn-based rpg to action combat did not go off entirely smoothly without a hitch. \n\nPros\n\n+The combat,press-turn-system,fusions,and Persona spell-casting carried over surprsingly well into the hack n slash/beat em up format!\n\n+A decent continuation that expands upon the concepts presented in its' predecessor.\n\n+ New characters fit in with the rest of the cast.\n\n+Good soundtrack coupled with the VAs doing a servicible job in their respective roles.\n\n+The exploration and platforming break up the monotony of the battles.\n\n+Objects in the environment can be exploited to give you a more direct advantage during fights.\n\n+Good message about forgiveness and having empathy for others.\n\nCons\n\n-Cannot decide if it is a lighthearted road-trip OVA or a tense paranormal/supernatural/mystery thriller.\n\n-Dialogue and down-time between missions can be very dense,especially if you compare Strikers to other musou games. \n\n- The stealth and \"surprise attack \" mechanics that complimented the dungeon/palace infiltration in Persona 5 come off as a hindrance in Strikers. \n\n-RPG inspired roots ensure there is an intense level of grinding. No,it's not as bad as a gacha game but be ready to commit regardless!\n\n-Where's Katsumi?\n\n-Would have been rad if Goro Akechi made a guest appearance. Oh well,perhaps next time!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a spin-off set after the events of Persona 5 featuring most of the Phantom Thieves, developed in tandem with Omega Force and with significantly different gameplay to mainline Persona games.\n\nI think that the gameplay differences are ultimately a good thing because turn-based combat, as good as it is in P5, gets boring eventually so the mix-up is appreciated here. The combat is fast-paced and can be engaging, however personally it's not ideal. Whilst I like character action and hack and slash games, P5S is essentially dynasty warriors with a persona skin, and I have some issues with that.\n\nThe hordes of enemies the game throws at you regularly make it very difficult to see what is actually happening on screen, and it doesn't feel like player skill is all that important in the grand scheme of things, rather most battles are just stat checks or a test of how long your patience will last against a bullet sponge. Fortunately, the effects look pretty decent and the music is fantastic as usual - so things don't get too boring.\n\nIn terms of story, P5S does some things well; the story is fairly interesting towards the middle-end, it's nice to see more of some of the Phantom Thieves and Zenkichi is a great character addition (he reminds me how much I would love a future persona game to feature a largely adult cast). But there are also a few failings; I think the story is too similar to themes that have already been explored in Persona 5 and Royal, and for the first half-or-so of the game it is far too formulaic in it's story-telling. Ultimately, it's quite predictable, which would be fine if things weren't presented as 'twists'.\n\nI also have to say I was a bit disappointed by the absence of most of the characters that were in Persona 5 and Royal, and I feel that although it's set after Persona 5 it doesn't feel like it's a true sequel to the story.\n\nAnd one final note because this was definitely the most annoying thing throughout my playthrough... The menus look great and all but they play so many animations when switching between menus that it significantly slows down navigating them, I also found the animation that plays when entering and exiting jails is too long when you're encouraged to go in and out often. Maybe it's a bit of a nitpick but for a fast-paced action game like this, the fact that the menus are way more cumbersome to navigate than the ones in P5 gets very frustrating very quickly, especially when you forget you're not controlling Joker so you can't swap out the character you're controlling in the menu.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a nice addition to the Phantom Thieves story which has a reasonable completion time, so I recommend it if you liked Persona 5 and want to see more of the main characters.",

        "content": "Positive experience overall, but I wouldn't pay much more than 30 bucks for this.\n\nFirst of, there's basically absolutely no way I can recommend this if you haven't played p5 or p5r. A significant amount of the enjoyment I got from the game comes from watching the Phantom Thieves reunite and mess around in their tour around Japan and Jails(This game's version of Palaces). Playing around on a beach, visiting landmarks, tasting local cuisine; the characters having fun is pretty fun to watch.  Some of the characters even get some additional characterization which can range from meh to decent. \n\nOther than that? Zenkichi and Sophia are likeable additions to the team. Their respective character arcs couldn't be more predictable, but they at least get decent pay offs. It also helps that they have colourful enough personalities and designs which blend in surprisingly well with the rest of the phantom thieves.\n\nThe combat is also pretty decent, though it can get draggy if you don't make use of your skills to hasten through certain fights. \n\nThere are more negatives. The story rehashes a lot of elements from the original game's story, except most of the climatic moments didn't have the build up and pacing leading up to them to make said moments especially emotional. Conceptually, it had a lot of potential. It was just executed rather poorly. Has a few cool moments though. \n\nMost of the sidequests are so boring I wonder why they're there in the first place. \n\"Kill X Number of Y Mob with Z Character\" \n\"Collect X Number of Y Item Drop\"\n\"Revisit a boss and kill it a second time\"\n\nThat's about it really. The only thing that I can add on is that it maintains the visual flare from the original p5. All in all, it was fun and I'm glad I played it, but the game is riddled with some serious issues that makes it difficult to recommend at it's original price tag. Not to mention it's only like 20-30 hours.",

        "content": "Just to get it out of the way, if you're expecting an experience that even holds a candle to royal in any way, shape or form, you're going to be severely let down. P5S is basically just a story expansion pack in terms of its narrative, and retreading old ground is the name of the game. To the point where [spoiler] All the antagonists are just copies of the palace rulers with very slight tweaks, and the main antagonist is literally a somehow worse version of Yaldabaoth, right down to her design. The entire endgame is nearly identical to vanilla p5's: Go through not-mementos to kill not-holy grail to stop a false god devoid of humanity who is attempting to mind control all of mankind because they don't want free will anymore. It's such a step down from Maruki in every way that it enters freefall. [/spoiler]\n\nThe music is still mostly bangers and remixes of bangers, but the normal battle themes, while far from bad, do not even come close to 'take over' or 'last surprise'.\n\nThe gameplay is button mashy, but that's to be expected of a warriors style game. When the combat is fun, it's quite satisfying to pull some crazy move and kill 50 enemies at once. But when it's not fun, you'll be mindlessly hacking at the shins of a massive damage sponge while it one-shots you with every attack.\n\nBut the gameplay isn't what you come to this game for, you come to P5S to spend more time with the characters you love, and the game does a serviceable job giving the phantom thieves plenty more funny and heartfelt moments with each other. Unfortunately though, the game doesn't include any confidants other than the main group, and assumes that you spent valentine's day with Ryuji, meaning that there is very little actual continuation from the original game. Not only that, Yoshizawa doesn't even exist in this game's timeline, as for some baffling reason it was made as a sequel to vanilla P5 and lacks all of the story beats and characters introduced in Royal. The story barely even mentions the events of the original game, and when it does they're often throwaway bits of banter or a single dialogue option that elicits the same response as the other choices.\n\nThe side content SUCKS. Every single request you can get is either a mindless fetch quest in the overworld (without the ability to sprint) or agonisingly boring backtracking to levels you've already cleared. Go to this level and kill this specific enemy that only appears in this one location that's annoying to get to, then kill this specific enemy BUT with a specific character, AND THEN [spoiler] go back and kill the boss of a previous level again with no changes whatsoever. [/spoiler] It's padding at its most egregious, and it straight up locks gameplay perks behind it, making some of them pretty much mandatory.\n\nThe voice acting is way lower quality than in P5 or Royal, which is bizarre since the Va's sound identical to their 2016 selves in the latter. They either were given bad direction or the dev team went with bad takes, and it can be a bit distracting coming fresh off Royal. (Seriously Futaba sounds like she's drunk half the time and Ryuji's voice cracks every other word.)\n\nMassive nit pick as the cherry on top: the menus have these cute little animations to them that are cool at first, but become agonising when you're just trying to get through the menus quickly and have to wait for the animations to play out before you can do whatever you're trying to do. Also, a r e y o u d o u b l e c h e c k i n g t h e r e q u e s t??\n\nIf there's a sale going on and you're a die-hard lover of these characters and this world like me, this game can be worth it for just a few more hours with the phantom thieves. But if you're expecting it to be an improvement or proper continuation to literally anything from its forebear, you'll be sorely let down.",

In the contrary it has a lot of persona element and it is definitely enjoyable if you get used to it. The story is decent, the new characters are good so no need to worry about that. One thing it does better than p5/p5r is that it has way better end-game content. Your persona and character actually are carried over to new game+.\n\nSadly there is none p5r content in the game.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a bit of an oddball. It's a canon spin-off that assumes you played the base game, but it omits details from Royal. It\u2019s also a Mus\u014d game with surprising complexity and the smallest scale battles in the genre. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for Persona games to have weak beginnings and Strikers is no exception. Players are inundated with lousy tutorials and gameplay-interrupting cutscenes. It\u2019s no wonder there are numerous negative reviews complaining about the supposed difficulty of the game. To put it as inelegantly as possible: unless those reviewers were playing on Merciless, this is a colossal example of a skill issue. While the tutorial is mediocre, the onus is on the player to use every tool in the game to succeed. Once you acquire the Master Arts for each Phantom Thief, the gameplay is like flowing water. Chaining special attacks and Persona skills into All-Out attacks feels great, and there are further opportunities for skill expression. Late-game bosses can be cut down like a knife through butter by remotely competent players.\n\nThere isn't much to discuss about Strikers' story, it's more Persona 5. While the story arcs are similar and many of the villains are laughably one-dimensional, Strikers shines with its upbeat charm and flashy aesthetic. Just don\u2019t go in with hopes of a villain on par with Maruki, you\u2019ll be disappointed. \n\nStrikers has a few remaining flaws. There are frame drops during cutscenes. The tension and pacing of dungeons are nonexistent since you can leave and return with full HP and SP. Ambushing Shadows is less precise than Persona 5. There's no \u201cregister all\u201d button for the Velvet Room, and the way you purchase equipment in Sophie\u2019s shop is unnecessarily inefficient, which is baffling considering Persona 5 solved this issue back in 2016. If you can overlook this, the game is a fine but flawed sequel.",

        "content": "controls are a little wonky but the innovation is there. Gameplay so far encourages you to use all your party members and Joker's wild card in musou format seems to make good sense (i.e you can use free skills in your combo depending on the persona you have equiped).\nOnly issue is that theres alot to pay attention to so having a controller to slow down the game is a must. You could probably compare this game to ff11 / ff15 action strategy hybrid.\n\nThat said, i'm glad another action orientated game has been added to SMT. I've been wanting one since they stopped making Devil Summoner games.\n\nIn terms of story, they've flipped the script and the gang is exploring new territory this time around with social media being one of mediums for influencing 'cognition'.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nFinished the game. Honestly glad i picked this up, a lot of the nit picks i had with P5R were tightened up in the gameplay this time around - i.e ambushing is slightly tricky and dangerous if you mess up - this makes it harder to keep alarms down to continue exploring. I would also stress again, the game makes it viable for you to play as everyone so you're not going to find yourself in a Tales situation where you can just play the game as your starting MC forever and call it a day. Overall a moderately challenging game that nudges you into trying new playing styles to keep it fresh. \n\nAs for story it was serviceable. Nothing too over the top but the main draw is just touring around Japan with the crew. Haru is also given a lot more screen time this time around.",

        "hours": 2713,
        "content": "First off, if you didn't play Persona 5, this game is not for you. There is a legitimate story in this game that extends beyond the standard musou spinoff plot of \"all your favourite characters have been sucked into a non-canonical alternate universe\". It assumes that you have played through P5 all the way to the end. As such, the rest of this review will contain spoilers for P5.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is honestly a very weird game to review. It is a musou or warriors-style game that tries to cram as many P5 mechanics into a musou game as possible, and the end result is a musou game that is utterly unique, though in a way that is likely to annoy many players who are approaching this game purely from the musou perspective. However, P5 fans will see these quirks as knowing references to the original game and appreciate them nonetheless, even if the game is somewhat jankier as a result.\n\nPlot-wise, P5S picks up not long after the end of P5 (the base game, not the Royal ending). The phantom thieves meet up for summer vacation only to find that people are messing with the Metaverse once again even after they destroyed Mementos. This meddling has resulted in change-of-heart incidents all over Japan, which the police have decided to pin on the Phantom Thieves. Thus, the gang now has to go on a road trip all across Japan, solving Metaverse crimes and clearing their own name.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the writing in P5S feels like a lighter but still authentic-feeling version of what we got in P5. One interesting angle that P5S takes is that while most of the Palace rulers in P5 are straight up irredeemable villains, all of the Jail monarchs (this game's version of the Metaverse) in P5S are sympathetic people who have been wronged in one way or another and got tempted to use the powers of the Metaverse to take revenge on society. Many of them have backstories that directly challenge the beliefs of the Phantom Thieves, causing them to question how right and just their actions are. Unfortunately, while these are interesting ideas, they do not have time to develop properly due to the much shorter length of P5S, both in terms of gameplay time and in-universe calendar days. While a typical Palace in P5 might consist of two weeks of investigating the backstory of the Palace ruler, two weeks given to infiltrate the palace and steal the treasure and another two weeks to see the fallout of the change of heart and how it affects everyone, in P5S you will typically discover a Jail, learn about the ruler's backstory, perform a change of heart and move on to the next city all in less than a week.\n\nHowever, if there's one area where the writing of P5S really shines, it's in the cheerful and bubbly character interactions amongst the Phantom Thieves. If you enjoyed the many interactions between team members in P5 during the less serious moments, such as the beach day, the Hawaii trip and the cultural festival, P5S is a treasure trove of moments like that. After all, the premise of the game is a cross-country summer vacation road trip, and every new city they visit is an excuse for them to enjoy the local tourist attractions. If you're a Futaba or Haru fan especially, they have much more screentime in P5S than P5 because they're part of the starting roster right from the beginning.\n\nIn terms of battle mechanics, most of it is standard musou game fare. You have a light attack and a heavy attack, and combining them in various ways leads to various combos that have various effects like air launchers and crowd control. Every playable character also has a unique mechanic associated with them. For example, Ann can infuse her whip with fire so that her normal attacks also deal fire damage, and Ryuji can activate a stance that increases his defense and knockback resistance. The unique mechanic that P5S brings compared to other musou games is the return of elemental weaknesses and resistances from P5. You can deal elemental damage by either spending SP to cast Persona abilities as AOE damage effects, or by using certain attack combo paths that naturally end with your character summoning their Persona without using SP. Hitting a regular enemy with an elemental weakness will trigger a small all-out attack which damages all enemies in the area, while minibosses and bosses have shield icons that must be broken with elemental attacks. Breaking a single shield will lead to a one-more attack which is a bit of free damage against them, while breaking all the shields will trigger a much larger all-out attack which deals a lot of damage and leaves the boss downed for a period of time.\n\nOn one hand, I don't really mind the elemental system from an offensive standpoint. Some people complained that bosses only take chip damage from everything besides elemental attacks, but every musou game has enemies split between fodder grunts that only exist to charge your ultimate ability and actually threatening enemies that need you to focus and think for a bit. On the other hand, I really don't like the elemental system from a defensive standpoint. Like I said, in musou games you're meant to treat the hundreds of small enemies as invisible and focus on the few large enemies, but in this game the small enemies also have elemental attacks, and some of them are super-effective against your character's Persona. Getting hit by a super-effective elemental attack, even from a grunt enemy, can stun you and lead to you getting comboed to death by the miniboss, and it's impossible to keep track of every small enemy when there can be literally dozens of enemies on screen at any one time.\n\nThe pacing of the combat sections is lifted straight out of P5, which will probably annoy many musou fans. Most musou games have you running through a decently large battlefield, taking down roaming groups of enemies while prioritising specific targets according to the story. In P5S, you take down one group of enemies, then you get a cutscene explaining a new story development, then another fight, then another cutscene etc. This is basically exactly how the Palaces in P5 functioned, but this is highly atypical for a musou game and people who are not accustomed to the pacing of P5 will probably get annoyed. Also, there is a very weird and annoying quirk with the game where you are allowed to exit the Jail at various checkpoints to fully recover health and SP and go back into the Jail at the same point, it doesn't advance the calendar and there is no penalty for doing so. In fact, the game explicitly tells you that this is a legitimate tactic. In that case, why not let the checkpoint heal you directly, instead of making you wait through 2 loading screens to exit and re-enter the Jail?\n\nAlso, most of the P5 gameplay outside of dungeon-crawling has essentially been removed in P5S. The calendar system is in the game essentially in name only. There is no deadline for clearing Jails, and leaving and re-entering Jails does not advance the calendar. The calendar only advances with main story completion and the time-management aspect of P5 is no longer present. There are also no social stats for you to level up, so your time spent outside of Jails will consist mainly of buying supplies and talking to your teammates to get side quests. However, to compensate for that, all the Jails you visit will still remain accessible even after you clear them and you will revisit them to complete side quests, which is a departure from P5 Palaces.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anybody who played P5, enjoyed the interactions of the Phantom Thieves and wished that there was more of that to snack on. If you're the kind of person who loved all the vacation side stories in P5 and wished that there was a game which is 50% of just that, then this game is definitely for you. Honestly I would hesitate to recommend P5S at full price, but this game goes on pretty steep discount quite frequently and it's definitely worth picking up during a sale.",

The story isn't as strong right off the bat, but on top of that the gameplay also isn't as strong. I say this as someone that doesn't really like turn based RPGs. The gameplay of this reminds me closest of Dynasty Warriors and like Dynasty Warriors the combat neither satisfies nor challenges and I felt like I was coasting through the game.\n\nAt this point the phantom thieves know each other, and while each 'monarch' tries to relate to the phantom thieves for me it fell flat on the first two monarchs. Where as Persona 5 immediately gut punches you with a corrupt teacher abusing students, Strikers seems to just.. start. The first enemy is a pop star abusing her fans which never grabbed me. There's little in the way of character development as all of the phantom thieves already had their character development and got to know each other.\n\nIn the end this game is for folks that just want to see another adventure for the Phantom Thieves, but be warned it doesn't touch the quality of the original.",

Let me share with you my favorite part of this musou hack-and-slash brawler game with a Persona skin:\n\nYou will enter an area, get a bunch of story, take 2 steps, get some dialog about a monster, fight the monster, take two steps, get a bunch of story, take 2 steps, get some dialog about a monster, fight the monster, and these steps will repeat until you finish the area.  In the middle, you're going to get interrupted nonstop with tutorials until they're done, and then you're going to get some more you didn't think existed.\n\nAll the while, 2 steps, stop, fight, 2 steps, stop, fight, 2 steps, stop, fight.\n\n30 hours of that.\n\n10/10 A++ would musou this way again!\n",

The story is practically non existent following the same twists the P5 had. however if you are like me and want to play just to hear the Phantom theives chat and hang out this game is worth it, when it's on sale. But full price the game just doesn't compate to P5 or even P4 for that matter.",

Honestly, by the lock boss before the end of the 2nd jail I am completely done with it.  The HP pools of the bosses have ground my enjoyment of the game down to 0.  Learning patterns and rinsing and repeating over and over for far too long is the reason I don't play NASCAR games and is now the reason I will never play this again.  I've got better things to do than go to one boss battle after an another spending anywhere from 20-30 minutes doing the same things over and over.  Otherwise, the elemental system from Persona was interesting to work with in a musou but doesn't fit as well as it does in a turn based RPG.  The story so far has been a mix of all right and mediocre and since I just finished putting 176 hours in P5R, it was nice to have a continuation with the characters but sadly, this was a waste of my money and I will never play it again.",

I thought about playing Strikers before P5 since it released on Steam first, but I am so glad I waited so I could meet the characters properly. As far as Musou game sequel/spinoffs go, this is a great one that pulled off the same effects as Fire Emblem Warriors Three Hopes. I got to meet some old friends, make some new ones, and enjoy an already-built world in a new format.",

The gameplay is a pretty big shift for those who have grown acclimated to Persona's turn based style. Yes, the camera controls are absolutely vile, and you may need to reach near-divinity to process all the information on screen, but you get used to it pretty quick. Once you find your favorite character(s) to play and get some levels under your belt, things get a lot smoother. The story maintains the bar of quality set by Persona 5, definitely continuing its style, and the new characters that come along for the ride are a blast, and bring some unique angles to the Phantom Thieves. Once the story gets going, it's hard to put down.\n\nAll in all, 10/10, and as a side note, you should definitely let Haru drive, trust me.",

Poor visuals, cut content, lack of an enjoyable combat system and uninteresting music leaves much to be desired. What remains is a decent story which is a replica of the original Persona 5, a couple of new likeable characters and the fantastic cast - The Phantom Thieves.\n\nPerformance is a mess, need to set affinity to utilize all processors which minimizes stuttering.\n\nAlthough a chore to complete because of the off-putting combat system, Strikers is a must for anyone who wants more of the Phantom Thieves. It's not any better than Royal, very far from it but it will help fill the void that Royal will have left.",

        "content": "Coming into Persona 5 Strikers, I thought the game would be a fun spin off where I get to see all my favorite characters in a hack and slash game. However after completing this game I'm more than happy to say that this game is more than just a spin off, but a worthy sequel to the Persona 5 story and an excellent addition to the franchise. \n\nThe combat in the game at first was a challenge at first, but after getting used to the controls it felt smooth and it incorporated the core elements of Persona 5's battle system like baton bass and persona creation excellently. Each character felt like they had a unique combat style that matched their character and were all fun to use, with my favorite's being Yusuke and Zenkichi.\n\nThe story was also a strong point of the game, and the two new members of the phantom thieves, Sophia and Zenkichi, were wonderful addition to the main cast and added a lot of life to this game. The story also allowed characters that didn't get as much development in the original game to get fleshed out more, with Haru getting the most development out of any the original cast. The villains of this game had some really great boss designs and were characterized in a sympathetic light, which allowed them to act as foils and further the growth of certain members of the Phantom Thieves.  My favorite part of this game was while there was an overarching plot about freeing people from their trauma, the game also spent a lot of time on slice of life elements. It really did feel like I was on a road trip with good friends, and made me appreciate the Phantom Thieves characters that much more. \n\nThe visuals of this game are top notch and maintain the flair and art style from the original game that we all know and love. The soundtrack is phenomenal and just as good as the soundtrack from Persona 5 Royal. Lyn absolutely brings her A game to the table with all the new songs featuring her, and the remixes of songs such as Last Surprise and Blooming Villain do the originals justice.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend Persona 5 Strikers to anyone who is a fan of Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal that just wants to spend some more time with the characters that many of us have come to love. It's a fantastic addition to the franchise and I hope Atlus will continue explore the world of Persona 5 in the future.  \n\nAn easy 10/10!",

Story itself is very similar to main storyline of P5, but it flows better thanks to pre-established PT characters and is very interesting because of its focus on trauma and tie-ins with PTs. It does start kinda dry tho, but picks up later.\nNew characters are great, espeically new additions to the PTs.\nGameplay is dynasty warrior style action rpg, its good, but sometimes bosses can feel a bit spongey.\nSoundtrack is more fire from Lyn.\n\nOnly bad part is PC port. \n60 fps and compressed assets suck. I wish they would do a refresh with 120 fps and 4K assets like they did with P5R. \nDefault controls are pretty terrible.\nI was also constantly getting this annoying bug where your hotkeys just stop working in menus until you alt-tab.\nAlso loading times are pretty terrible, even on NVMe SSD.",

The gameplay wise it's obviously very different from turn based combat but nothing too crazy.

Everyone who ever played a Hack n' Slash like the Musou-Titles or Senran Kagura games should feel right at home.\n\n*Mind you Strikers was in development the same time as the upgraded Royal Version of Persona 5 was tho, so Story elements which were added with the updated Royal release do not get mentioned in Strikers.",

        "content": "Okay game, horrible port. Buy only if you really want more Persona 5 content, and even then just try get it on a console or something.\n\nConstant crashes mixed with no autosave (???) and awkward placement of manual save points (luckily cutscenes even with chooseable dialogue options are completely skipable) , barebones support for PC graphic options, esp over 1080p/FHD.\n\nGameplay is hit or miss leaning on miss. Mixing hack n slash with normal Persona turnbased elements, like how Dynasty Warriors does it, but worse. The real time actions of the enemies makes it frustrating to use strategic skills and the hack n slash part does not feel good to play standalone (saving grace is Yusuke with his carbon copy Vergil moveset). \nTo do well in hard mode feels more like needing to grind levels and cheese skills and items you to obtain from mindless mob grinding (kill trash mobs in an area, leave the area, kill the new batch that respawned and repeat) to beat the insanely bloated HP of bosses and mini bosses; otherwise you'll be stuck in a 30 min clunky boss fight that ends prematurely because you ran out of SP and your computer friends died somewhere between the fight starting and you zoning out after watching the boss's health bar tick down at like 1% every 5 minutes. The AI teammates in your party act like basic computers reacting to enemy attacks (ironically not smart enough to be AI), yet somehow manage to still be useless to the point you have to babysit them esp on hard.\n\nStory is regular Persona business (pretty decent overall but not as good as the mainline games such as P5R, P4G, P3 etc.) but it is also completely linear and can be skipped through without missing too much (useful, because it's what I had to do after losing hours of saves multiple times). IMO it almost has ruins the impact of the story/ending Persona 5/Royal had given you, especially if you play this one right after.\n\nBanging music though, makes up for all the shortcomings. But again don't play this on PC unless you have to.\n\n(This was written after losing a few hours of grinding for the 3rd time)",

        "content": "This game is fun and I like it but i have a few problems with it.\n\nFirst is the anti-aliasing sucks balls, you either have everything blurred and smudgy or jagged.\nSecond is the difficulty spike between easy and normal, it goes from being baby mode to actually challenging, I was trying to beat a boss and wiped 5 times in normal but beat in 10 seconds on easy.\nThird is the PC controls are top tier garbage, you have to use a controller or you're gonna have a bad time.\nFourth is the price, this game feels so cheap it should not cost more than P5R which is also on steam. buy a key or get on sale.\n\nIf you can look past these issues then you'll have fun.",

        "content": "I enjoyed this game WAY more than I thought I would, definitely worth getting it.\n\nI loved how much it focuses on developing the character's friendship as a group, I think it's one of the strongest points it has, which is something the original P5 could have improved upon. The story is a bit predictable and has many repeated points with the original game, but some bits are really good. I'd almost say the main plotline is secondary until well past the halfway point of the game, up until that point it's basically Slice of life with dungeon crawling, and I don't mean it as a downside. The Phatom Thieves go on a vacation through Japan and it's full of hilarious moments.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the main complaint about this game since it's not turn-based, but people seem to forget this is a spin-off title developed by Tecmo Koei, and honestly as an action RPG it's very entertaining and considered to be one of the best they've developed. I found it incredibly overwhelming at the beginning with all the tutorials and characters with different playstyles, but I got used to it and appreciate that they made all characters playable, relevant and they actively encourage you to learn them.\nAlso the soundtrack is a complete banger, easily a top contender for best Persona soundtrack, put me Daredevil and Axe to Grind in a 10 hour loop and I'm a happy person.\n\nAs a side note: If you see the text blurry, disabling antialiasing fixes it. Graphically the game is not the prettiest while comparing it to P5 or P5R, and those games weren't pushing any boundaries either, but it's something completely secondary in this franchise",

The controls are awful.\n\nPersona 5 strikers allows your companions to be in fast combat with you. However this is a down side as your companions seem to have brain damage and can't fight properly. \n\nThey have taken out nearly everything that makes Persona what it is. If you're looking for a persona type game play you wont  find it with this game.\n\nPros:\nIt continues the story where persona 5 royal left off.\n\nIf you have never played or heard of a persona game and this is your first, you may enjoy it.\n\nMy thoughts:\nIf you enjoy persona games, I suggest you skip this one and just watch the story on youtube as this game is awful compared to the last one. I have no clue what they were thinking when they changed everything. I guess they don't understand the concept of if it's not broken don't fix it.",

The introduction of new characters made for perfect story and lore moments, and the finale was glorious. The finale fight reminded me of Miitopia because of how it played out, where you would split your party into 3 to take down the final boss. And finally, the characters have evolved so much from Persona 5. Not a damn thing was ruined about them in this game. The ONLY thing I can complain about was the Jack Frost mini boss. I sadly had to switch to easy mode to beat it. Grinding is kinda annoying in P5S (At least my my experience)",

        "content": "In short, Persona 5 Strikers is a wonderful game with a nice history, amazing voice actors and soundtrack, fun gameplay and beautiful graphics. I absolute recommend this game.\n\nFull review bellow, may cointain spoilers, I dont know.\n\nI really loved Persona 5 Strikers, not only it brought back our dear Phantom Thieves together filling that void that you get when your favorite game or show ends but it also delivered an amazing history and game.\n\nHistory\n\nI really enjoyed the history, usually Persona games are really straight foward, the bad guys are evil, the good guys bring them down, nothing wrong with that, however, in Persona 5 Strikers most of the villains arent actually evil people and its really good to see such shift from an abusive professor that beats middle schoolers and abuse them to an artist and singer consumed by sadness and sorrow doing some wrong things after obtaining an unknown power through Emma that could help them in running away from scars from the past.\n\nNot only it gave the gang a weird feeling after beating the shadow form of the villains, but they also felt so connected to the problems they were facing. Instead of having the usual hero vs villain fight to save the people, our dear Phantom Thieves wanted to help the villains aswell, since they were good people too! It was so nice to see that people could forgive people like Natsume cherishing his comeback or Mariko listening to the mother that lost his daughter saying that Mariko was really important to the city and wanted her as mayor again.\n\nWe're living times were people define you for mistakes you commited, you see on Social Media people absolutely terrorizing famous people lifes for errors they did 2? 6? years ago, ignoring that despite being famous they're humans aswell, imperfect and capable of changing. People do it to everyone nowadays, one mistake and your life is ruined.\nSo Persona 5 Strikers history brings a really important message, that not everyone that do mistakes are evil people, that people despite doing wrong things wether you forgive them or not CAN change. I really liked it, it is really important to have themes like this delivered to us.\n\nI really liked Sophia and Zenkichi, both were such well developed characters. Despite having the means to have an extensive knowledge, Zenkichi being a grown adult working for PubSec and Sophia an AI with full acess to information, both had such low knowledge of emotions and spent the whole journey learning. It was so warming to see Zenkichi coming to therms with Akane and finally facing Owada, thus, becoming a good father and a good friend to himself, no longer running away from his ideals and goals. Sophia, even though she is an AI, displayed so many emotions, everytime she interfered and spoke to villains, showing her views and ideas about what was going on, I could imagine her crying if she could, for an AI she has so much passion, its like even though she doesnt have a physical heart, it is there. She became a caring and loving friend, a true humanity companion :)\n\nIt was also nice to see how much Makoto and Haru matured, while Ryuji and Ann are still teenagers slacking their duties on school hahaha\n\nGameplay\n\nI enjoyed so much the way Atlus introduced Persona to hack n slash, it was really well done. Battling felt so satisfying with such beautiful graphics and soundtrack, the voice acting is top notch. Every character had an unique way of attacking and the way baton pass works in P5S was really well done.\nDespite having so much fun, there are things I believe it could be done diferently.\n\nSince the battles are so action packed and fast, having an image show every time you attack the enemy weakness not only becomes a visual polution but it also decrease the value that it had on previous Persona Games. It is so satisfying to see an image pop up with a close face of your character when you crit in Persona 4, it didnt feel that satisfying having the close up every time you attack the enemy weakness, sometimes it felt like it was delaying the battle and I know I just felt this way because the image showed every time. The close-up face image should only show sometimes, I suppose in future hack'n'slash games, Persona magic abilities could crit too and therefore the image would only show if the ability landed a crit? I dont know.\n\nI am grateful that the commands arent a mess for keyboard users, I had no problem playing this game on keyboard and could enjoy it's full experience despite not having a controller. I dont think its a flaw, its just an opinion, but, I wish they changed the default key for guns, it felt weird to use ctrl key + shift for charged shots and sometimes I accidentaly pressed the windows key, also, it was difficult to leave the Gun mode when using Sophia due to the keys being so far away. Maybe its a problem in my end, who knows.\n\nSoundtrack + Voice Acting\n\nAmazing as always, Persona games always deliver good music and this game is no exception! The new versions of musics used in Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal are REALLY good, I couldnt image that such good tracks could be improved since they were already good, but they improved them a lot to fit this game! Keeper of Lust in Persona 5 Strikers is such a banger, congratulations!\nAlso, thanks Atlus for possibility of choosing old Persona games battle musics, it was such cool addition, I really loved it.\n\nThe voice actings was perfect! There were so many emotional moments that would NEVER be as good as they are if the dub wasnt so well done! Yusuke telling Natsume to dont lump Sayuri with the soulless history that he wrote, Sophia and Ichinose/Konoe, Ryuji telling Emma to shut up when she was telling bad things to Sophia. So many good moments.\n\nAhh I feel like playing again just by remembering those moments haha, Persona 5 had such a good dub and Persona 5 Strikers keeps the tradition.\n\n-----\n\nThanks to everyone involved in the production of this game, it is really an amazing game and I felt so happy while playing it.\nThere are so many good things to write about Persona 5 Strikers that would make my review so big, but in short, thank you very much for creating such cool game for my favorite series!",

        "content": "summary get this if you finished persona 5 or royal.\n\nthis game is a p5/p5r base setting with changed battle system and also social system since the story set after p5 ending which you suppose to max confidant with all your friend. story wise still the same p5 vibe so if you like p5 you like this as well.\n\nas for gameplay most ppl think this is a warrior like gameplay with p5 skin, while truth is its persona/smt series base system but changed to warrior like battle style with it p5 battle adaption such as weakness/all out attack/baton pass/show time etc... it start out kinda difficult when you dont understand the game or you are not action game player, but as you play and understand the system more you feel the p5 adaption is on point. \n\noverall while the game is far from perfect but it put in effort to try new stuff instead of just skin change. maybe it will be better next adaption if there any.\n",

The system for leveling up Joker's personas is well made and allows for some extremely complex planning, and hitting enemy weaknesses feels gratifying. \n\nLiterally my only quarrel is that sometimes the audio balance for the voice acting feels way off.

        "hours": 6787,
        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers (P5S) is an action RPG title that is co-developed with Omega Force - who popularized Musou-style action genre with Dynasty Warriors series where the action revolves around mowing down ridiculous hordes of enemies. I initially posted my review at the 37h mark (around 3/4 of the story) but felt compelled after I've finished the game to make the review more complete, in order to do it justice - because the game went from being pretty good at first to being great when I was technically done with it. \n\nIt should be noted that P5S appears to be the canonical sequel to Persona 5 (P5), so if you're the type that needs to follow stories in chronological order, you might want to pass on this game for now. Personally, I've yet to play P5 myself although I do have some background having watched the awful Persona 5: The Animation before. If you have no background of P5, some names and terminology that come up in the game might leave you confused but I don't think they are a huge issue. And if you're invested in the story thereafter, then all the more reason to pick up Persona 5 Royal (P5R) - the definitive version of P5 also available on Steam - when you're done with P5S.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, other titles in the Musou genre (which I'll refer to as \"Musous\") are laid out in mission stages where the combat field (the stage itself) involves mowing down hordes of enemies while completing set objectives - visceral large-scale combat on an open field while being outnumbered and yet overpowered. However, P5S's game structure is that of a JRPG and is an authentic Persona experience. Instead of stages, P5S uses JRPG dungeons (known here as \"jails\") which become available as the story progresses. When encountering an enemy (or via scripted events) in dungeons, it will usually spawn a horde of enemies - this is where the Musou-influence comes into play. If you're familiar with Persona series, just think of the turn-based combat being replaced by action combat. There are some minor platforming/puzzle-solving in various dungeons which I didn't appreciate but they do add variety. Outside dungeons, you hang around in a designated open city like those in the Yakuza series except there's no fighting to be had. There are side quests in the game (known as requests) which are mostly kill/fetch quests - nothing super interesting but aren't annoying either. In terms of content, there's the main story comprising of a few dungeons. Finishing the story will allow you to make a clear save to access post-game content which comes in the form of requests to obtain the best weapons for your team. Finishing the post-game content will then allow you to start NG+ which also unlocks the highest difficult, \"Merciless\". In NG+, everything you previously earned is carried over. There are a total of 9 playable characters and 8 of them are accessible from the start of your first \"non-tutorial\" dungeon while the 9th will join later in the story. In NG+, you can access all 9 in the first actual dungeon.\n\nCombat is one area the game shines in and caters to various styles of play. The controls in the game are responsive and all the Persona mechanics are very well integrated into the combat. Your attacks are made up by strings of basic attacks ending with a special attack. In addition, you have a dodge that has invincibility frames and can invest points in perks later on to capitalize on perfect dodges. If you're not a fan of fast-paced action, there's also a dedicated button to access your personas and also freezes time. There's also access to Persona fusion like any other Persona games. Different personas have different (but fixed) effects at the end of their combo strings, so finding a good mix of skills that work well alongside the combo strings is what the substance of build-making is - figuring out what skills are good and the fusion path to inherit the skills you want, to the target persona to fuse. In P5S, skills learnt by personas (i.e. not inherited from fusion) are always remembered and can be reconfigured when out of combat. The party size is up to 4 and members can be changed when out of combat, with the main restriction that Joker (the main protagonist) must always be in the team. So if you want to go at it alone, you can do so but only with Joker. All characters have a different play style and you can swap to any party (not team) member during combat. Progression takes the form of levels/equipment, persona roster, character-specific arts and a bond board which is used to unlock team-wide perks. Combat may initially feel plain and restrictive due to low SP gauge for abilities but gets better with game progression as characters learn new skills and from unlocking perks at the bond board. Although Musous tend to have a bad rep for being no-brainer button-mashers, P5S isn't quite the case and you can play it as a skill-based game by not abusing consumables, which will be in short supply anyway unless you grind for them. Boss fights are especially fun.\n\nThe story is pretty decent and the storytelling really shines here - compared to Persona 5 - which is helped by the good writing, overall presentation and a focus on bonding events. The dialogues are mostly full voiced and the English dub is pretty good. The script is well-written and there's a lot of humour which the voice actors did a really good job delivering. The story cutscenes and non-action-related gameplay takes up like 50% of the game, so if you're invested in the story, then it's great; if not, the game will feel like a beefed up visual novel with sparse but lengthy action gameplay in-between. While I did enjoy the story conversations, one gripe I have with it is that there's a lot of repeated info which feels like intentional padding rather than real value to the overall plot. For Persona fans specifically, there aren't any social links here and literally zero consequences to player choice. However, there are many bonding events that do a terrific job of fleshing out the friendship of the protagonists - like in Persona 4 Golden (P4G). P5 was disappointing to me story-wise, but P5S pretty much redeemed it for me - in fact, I prefer its story-telling over the former.\n\nPresentation is top notch in pretty much every Persona game I know of (since Persona 3) and this one is no slouch either. The UI is sleek and stylish while remaining usable. Combat looks amazingly flashy and feels good to pull off combos/abilities. My only gripe with the visuals is that the UI clutter can make fights with a lot of enemies difficult to read. The music was initially only serviceable for me, but did grew on me over time. I really like the themes in the dungeons of the later half and the remixes of the original Persona 5 tracks, like \"Blooming Villain\" and \"Keeper of Lust\". The track during the last phase of the final boss fight, \"Demiurge II: Negai\" was truly exceptional; it so well orchestrated with the last fight that it elevates it beyond epic - I think it's right up there with \"Ameno Sagiri\" (P4G), if not better. Most of these are arranged/composed by the Koei Tecmo Sound team, I believe.\n\nPerformance-wise, I'm happy to report that I didn't encounter any technical issues in the entirety of my 90+ hours playtime. Game runs great and loads fast on my AMD 2700X/GTX1060 6GB setup even when installed on a spinning HDD.\n\nIn conclusion, I've thoroughly enjoyed P5S and would strongly recommend it even at its asking price. It has a decent story that is well delivered and has a good amount of content going for it. The action combat is fun and caters well to players looking for simplicity or depth. As for replayability, it depends on how much you get tired of replaying the storyline over and over. But that's what I'm doing right now in NG+ merciless. Overall, fantastic game!",

        "content": "The dungeons are really neat, however the controls feel quite awkward, especially in menus. The one problem I have with the dungeons is they feel very empty especially compared to persona 5. Its alot of walk from point a to point b with very little combat in between. I do like the summoning mechanic in combat though as it brings a twist and allows combat to feel more refreshing.",

        "content": "Los Chorizos Fantasmas estan de vuelta para una ultima aventura.\n\nUnos meses despues del final de Persona 5, Joker y Morgana vuelven a Tokyo para pasar el verano con la banda y resulta que hay alguien jodiendo con el metaverso otra vez y cambiando los corazones de la poblacion, asi que los muchachos se ven obligados a hacer algo al respecto. La diferencia es que para esta altura los personajes ya son re porongas, asi que la amenaza principal no se siente tan apremiante. Sabes que los Phantom Thieves le van a romper la cara a quien esta detras de todo y eso deja lugar a un juego que no se toma tan en serio asi mismo y que tiene muchisimo fan-service e INCLUSO MAS humor que la entrega anterior\nEl juego tiene el framing de un Road Trip, lo cual es una idea genial. Vas viajando por todo Japon en un motorhome por cuestiones de la historia, pero esto mismo es una excelente excusa para ver a los personajes viviendo alocadas aventuras (y morfando hasta el hartazgo) en distintas ciudades.\n\nAlgo importantisimo a aclarar es que para esta entrega el sistema de combate deja de ser por turnos y pasa a ser tipo hack and slash, pero super rapido y estilizado. Piensen Devil May Cry pero contra docenas de enemigos al mismo tiempo. Asimismo, la musica de combate son, en su mayoria, versiones mixadas de temas clasicos de Persona 5, pero en versiones tirando a metal. Keeper of Lust y Last Surprise se llevan las palmas. Una maravilla como siempre la musica, no es de extra\u00f1ar.\n\nEn fin, es una mas que digna despedida para estos personajes tan queridos. Ojala los volvamos a ver algun dia.",

In true Japanese fashion, you constantly get showered with new poorly thought-out systems above poorly thought-out systems above, well you get it, which you can nearly entirely ignore, because, just button mash and play rock paper scissors. Equip weapon with moar damage equip armor with moar defense equip persona with moar stats\n\naAt least at the beginning, you can't take 5 steps without triggering a cutscene that goes hey there is an enemy hey you can jump up there hey there is a treasure chest\n\nThe presentation, VA, just general style, are all truly top notch, I'll give them that ... and that's about all the positivity I can muster.

It is more prettier than P5R.\nPerformance : Never had any performance issues with my intel i7 8th gen, 16GB DDR3 ram,  Gtx 1060 6GB locked in 60 fps.\nStory: The story is good. not as detailed as other persona games but you will have fun time. The writing is really good and there are some cheesy line. Futaba might annoy you with some dialogues but other than that it's fine.\nCombat: oh boy it's hit or miss. First I don't like the combat (recommending to play it in easy mode). It's dynasty warrior with persona paint on it. you can use you persona ability, items, baton pass but it's totally different game. I stopped playing after defeating first 2 villains. A month later i came back and exploring third dungeon and I really liking it now. Maybe it's because I was missing turned based combat that's why I didn't like the combat in the first place. In those months i was playing Persona 3 FES and some shooter games. I am surprised how good the combat feels now and on top of that the third dungeon is s cool. Dungeon crawling is really good i like it since i played it for the first time, it has nice platforming which I enjoy.\n\nconclusion: It's not a spin off game. It is a sequel. It has lot of references from P5, There are some characters who related with Persona 5 characters and phantom thieves. If you never played any persona games before then try it who knows you may get hooked. Trying something new is always fun until you understand how battle system works.",

        "content": "Not only is Strikers a solid spin-off game play wise. But also a good semi-sequel story wise with the new characters having the spotlight which shifts the focus off of the phantom thieves, however Strikers acts as a nice way to see more of the main cast. \nOverall, i would recommend this game to anyone who has played P5 Royal or vanilla. I wouldn't go into this expecting persona 5 2 but more like a well made side adventure with some good new ideas and characters.",

        "content": "Whereas this game's fanbase is a cancer, this is still an excellent ghame. Try not to listen to the people calling it overrated garbage. The small but vocal amount of people calling the the game overrated were told by others that it was the best game ever made, and when it did not meet those expectations, they justifiably thought it was overrated. This may be the best game ever to many, but not all. No matter what however, calling the game simply 'bad' instead of 'not perfect' or 'not my thing' would be an outright lie. Gameplay is tight and very creative, playing into the plot perfectly. I will not reveal any spoilers about this game since it is best to go in completely blind. If you are even somewhat interested in the genre or intrigued by the screenshots, buy this game. You will not regret it.",

        "content": "TL;DR - A slightly diluted sequel of vanilla Persona 5 with action-oriented combat and the soul of the original game, play only if you've played and liked P5.\n\nOh boy, it took me a quite a while to get through the somewhat overwhelming and slow first few hours of the game but in the end it was worth it. The \"issues\" I ran into at the start are subjective, you get to use all of the characters at the start and there is a lot to learn, not to mention playing on Hard difficulty made it difficult for me to progress until I got the hang of some mechanics as I was getting destroyed so it was mostly my fault.\n\nThe game is difficult only if you're unsure of what you're doing, as you get through the game and learn combos, how to manage your resources and what's important, it becomes much easier.\n\nWhat makes the game diluted is that the jails are less in-depth than palaces and there are no confidants, so it is a much more streamlined experience with fewer things to tie you to the story and characters emotionally, though the original in a way did that for you already.\n\nThe combat itself is in my opinion superior to the turn-based version because of the depth, you can control 4 characters at once with Joker being the wild card (being able to use multiple personas), and each character has their own combos including mechanics like dodging, parries and perfect dodges. As you learn these things you'll be able to handle most things in the game with ease.\n\nThe story, while not on par with vanilla's, is still good despite being slow for the first two or three jails, after that point the entire progression of jails changes and everything flows much more smoothly. It really does feel like a sequel (because it is) and not some spin-off, it is perfect if multiple playthroughs of the original games don't cut it anymore. What holds it back a bit is that the stakes are noticeably smaller, or to put it differently, since the Phantom Thieves are no longer newbies, saving the world only feels like a road trip and not a struggle for survival like it did in the original games.\n\nThe music for me PERSONALLY is less consistently good but when comparing it to P5's music standards it is still really good, I simply have more memorable soundtracks in the original comparing to Strikers.\n\nThe game has a post-game with beefed up bosses and some new content, as I am writing this I haven't yet tried this content but I intend to clear it, I went from feeling uneasy whenever I thought about struggling to welcoming the challenge now that I know how to approach the gameplay.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and I would implore every Persona 5 fan to try it, I really hope there will be more Persona 5 media in the future because despite playing Vanilla and Royal multiple times, saying goodbye again still stings.\n\n8.5/10",

If ur a die hard fan of the franchise I would def pick this up, but if you played the OG P5 cause everyone was talking about it, just leave it at P5 and dont really bother with this game.

The story so far has also been really solid and not just the \"bare minimum to explain why you're fighting.\"",

The only thing I  can say \"negative\" for this game is its not a continuation of Persona 5 Royal but vanilla Persona 5 instead so no Kasumi or Maruki are here. Another thing they could have used a save transfer system for this game from Persona 5 to Strikers so we could have flesh out Jokers romance choice in here but its pure empty as if he was single for the Persona 5 so in canon he didn't choose anyone. But the story and characters for this game really overshadowed all of this nitpicks of mine. A must buy for Persona 5 fans even if you only played Royal .",

Maybe it is also effects of \"X Warriors\" series from Koei Tecmo/Omega Force.\n\nStill if you wanted to see what happens after some time your \"Persona 5 (Royal)\" story and also if you like \"X Wariors\" series like myself you can play it without worry.

I'm down to play if they fix this mess but in it's current state it doesn't run well on higher end computers. I have an intel i9 12900k, a 3080 and 32 gbs of ram and if I don't increase the games priority to high and adjust the apps affinity to be able to use all CPU cores it will stutter and freeze even on the pre-rendered opening cut scenes. Very disappointed I can't play because I was looking forward to this game. Fix the game and I'd be happy to recommend.",

        "content": "i love persona 5 so naturally playing its sequel was something i really wanted to do and while i havent finished it yet i feel like ive put enough time to have an opinion\n\nthe gameplay is awesome, they got everything that makes persona 5 what it is and somehow converted it into a completely different genre, the music is also really good and really fits [tho some are reused] however i will now list the technical issues this game has that ive noticed so far \n\nthe audio mixing is really bad. sometimes the music is too loud, sometimes theres this weird reverb on th dialogue making them really hard to hear, sometimes the voices are so quiet you cant hear them all \n\nthe optimization is wonky, i couldnt get AA to work without having to open my gpu control panel to fix it, if you run this game at 60 fps which lets be honest you will and the frame rate drops at any point, instead of the frame rate actually dropping the game just  slows down... literally and ironically that makes some fights extremely difficult as input lag also goes up as the game slows down \n\nthe controls are great.. with a controller, do not play this game with mouse and keyboard its truly awful \n\nhowever i still really recommend this game, its lots of fun even with its issues",

Everyone's on Summer Break, and it becomes a roadtrip of the good ol' Persona variety. The game implements the mechanics of Dynasty Warriors and Persona 5 itself very nicely, with the UI being heavily stylized via Persona, and the mechanics mixing the two to a satisfying degree. \n\nIf you're a fan of Persona 5, I'd still pick it up even if you don't necessarily enjoy Dynasty Warrior games, since the story and gameplay both feel very well tuned to Persona.",

        "content": "Having never played a musou type game before and being on the fence of getting this i saw the game only costed 24 dollars and decided to get it. I wanted to write an early review of what i thought about the game if anyone else was on the fence of getting it so i played for about 6 hours to get a general feel, before going in i knew there wasn't social links and i was fine with that but if your looking for that kinda stuff its not here really\n\nNow this review is from the stand point of having never played a musou game but i can say this game is very fun for me it might be terrible from a mosou veterans stand point but honestly your probably only playing this if your a fan of persona in the first place\n\nAs a disclaimer I played with a controller since the MK controls seemed awful \nThe combat is real time all out brawls while being surrounded by shadows but the actual combat boils down to basically pressing X and then Y for a finisher which is usually your personas ability which is FREE to do without SP. Which is amazing because SP drains fast in this game if your manually casting spells. And this game lets you play as any of the phantom thieves (besides akechi and yoshizawa) i found my self playing more as the other characters then Joker but i mostly played ryuji so i could dream of punt kicking that stupid cat into outer space. Each character has a very unique fighting style and move set (idk about morgona i haven't touched him) that encompass their persona,gun and melee weapons into their rushes and attacks ruji can charge up his attacks and his base Y makes him harder to flinch Ann and mokoto can imbue their weapons with their personas elements yusuke has parries and haru has massive aoes. There's also two new persona users shown off in the games opening cut scene one joined the phantom thieves at the first hour of game play and she uses yoyos shes pretty fun but there's another guy i saw using a persona in the opening cut scene of the game idk if he joins or is an antagonist though \n\nIf you played P5R you probably blew through the game without much trouble besides that dam space palace. So I came into this game expecting it to be easy so i cranked the difficulty up to hard and I was very wrong, It was actually hard for me even on normal to my surprise. Still i only have 6 hours so maybe this is just early game woes mixed with having never played a mosou before\n\nAnother point is that the game pretty much mandates a day 1 clear. To my surprise you could leave the palace and time wont progress at all, so i would drain my SP and HP leave buy some healing fuse personas ECT come back and be ready to go.\n\nOne Con i have so far is that characters that are not being played by you do not receive master arts XP which isn't to bad for the 4 people you really like considering you'll be using them often. but if you go against a boss say weak to nuclear and fire but don't use Ann or Mokoto at all your kinda outa luck because not only are they under leveled for not being in the party but they also dont have all their master arts compared to your main 4. so far this has been my only gripe with the game",

        "content": "Ugh.... I guess I'll review it. I loved P4G and P5R as the first disclaimer, and I'm not much for JRPGs. So this is the hack and slash \"sequel\" to P5. And I don't hate it? I'm not sure if I like it because it's P5 content or how it plays (despite it taking two attempts to get into it). If you really, really want more from the P5 Story go for it. If Japanese hack and Slash are your thing... go for it. If you are just coming to terms that you might have a thing for JRPGs.... I dunno... try it out. It's not bad just very, very different. And it is disconnected from the canon in the weirdest ways. Most of that can be explained that it got made at the same time as P5R by a different Studio and they had no idea. All in all it's a P5 hack and Slash that furthers the story and it has no technical faults. So i guess I recommend it but tbh I am not sure if I like this game or not.... Which you probably experience as well.\n\nWell I'm done with the game, \"For real\" this time. I have to say, that while the Gameplay didn't do it for me, I'd happily play through it again. Because as disconnected the story is from P5R, it's entirely good on it's own. There are more moments that moved me to tears, which is kinda hard to do, than there were in P5R. So It might not be a real Persona game, but it does it's very best to live up to one and I really hope that at least Sophia comes back in P6.",

        "content": "Loved persona 5 and its royal version. However this game is literally unplayable for me. I can't seem to get a stable 60 fps while in game, it seems a lot of people have this issue too, something to do with having 6 - 8 threads on your cpu. There seems to be some sort of fix but I've tried everything and the game at max plays at 41 fps. \n\nActually saddened and never thought I'd have to refund a game, specially a Persona one but here we are. It's been 1 year and this hasn't been fixed. Most likely it never will. If you have a medium rig, sure, buy it and try it out. If you have a powerful rig, don't waste your time on this game.\n\nEdit: Who are the two fanboys who put the \"jester\" award on every negative review lol",

This means if you arent spending what I can only assume is 3x the intended time in any given area (due to the enemy variety and lack of anything interesting happening while you mindlessly beat fodder to death for hours) your team gets smoked immediately (and i do mean i m m e d i a t e l y) and youre left to either dodge perfectly doing one person's damage on an enemy with hp scaled for 4 attackers for 10 minutes or spam gun attacks from across the map, which takes longer, but not enough longer than its worth dying even once while doing the more entertaining gameplay style.\n\nAnything lower than the highest difficulty:\nSpam any button and win every fight without even the slightest effort.\n\nBy the time I was frustrated enough fighting using only my gun from max range and swapped down a tick and realised this, I was too burnt out to continue. The conversations are entertaining enough, but only just enough, to make me consider picking it back up once I forget the torments of the combat in a few years.\n\nIf you really really really care about having more P5 interactions from ONLY the main cast (no one from royal, and no side confidants) save yourself the effort, play on the easiest difficulty and sprint through every combat section without deviating at all from the main story route.\nJust another classic Persona spinoff side hustle with the bare minimum effort put in to milk enough money for the next, sure to be just as amazing as 4 and 5, mainline Persona title.",

The gameplay feels smooth, fun and intuitive; giving the player very wide array of movement and ways to attack. Each member of the Phantom Thieves feel unique in terms of playstyle. The soundtrack, much like the previous game is absolutely amazing. The dialogue between the phantom thieves is fun and enjoyable. I only gripe with the game is how similar most of the jails feel, generally being 3 prison keeps, 1 trauma cell and boss battle each. Other than that, i thoroughly enjoyed playing the game. Definitely recommended, especially for players looking for a fresh style of musou games.",

        "content": "   I've had a complicated relationship with Persona 5 Strikers.\n\n   Years ago, when Joker was announced for Nintendo's Smash Ultimate, I had no idea just what I was getting into. The art style, the voices, the designs - I fell in love quickly. Upon playing Joker in Smash, I eventually bought Persona 5, and then Persona 5 Royal, and then I bought this.\n\n   Initially, I was so into it. The fast-paced Koei Tecmo ARPG combat was thrilling, with the banger arrangement of remade battle themes from Persona 5. The return to where I spent easily over 300 hours between Persona 5 and 5R, and meeting the cast again.\n\n   At some point, I believe around the middle of the game, I found myself starting to dislike it. To the extent that I actually had to set a motivator for myself to finish it. I made a bet with my coworker that I would give him $100 if he finishes the re-release of P5R on PC before I finish Strikers. That's how sluggish I was, pacing-wise. After returning to the game, I found that I was just under-leveled, and maybe had the difficulty too high. I'm not really experienced with these ARPGs.\n\nThere are some segments that are a bore compared to the fast-paced gameplay in the first palace. I didn't like the segments where I had to blindly walk around open areas and talk to NPCs to hear generic dialogue about what's going on, just to progress the story. This being said, those segments are brief, and the rest of the game forward makes that part of the game worth playing through.\n\n   If you've played Persona 5 or 5R like I have, you'll definitely want to play this game. Maybe it won't be your style of gameplay, and maybe it'll take you a while. I don't regret my 43 hours with this game. You won't either.",

        "content": "[h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW (FIRST LOOK):[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back to strike against the corruption overtaking cities across Japan. With the crew on summer vacation, Persona 5 Strikers will have you travel all over to figure out what is happening and redeem the hearts of those imprisoned at the center of this crisis. Unlike other games in the series, the gameplay is hack-and-slash, closer to Koei Tecmo's series, Dynasty Warriors, but paired with the Persona charm, it fits near perfectly. Outside of combat, you will walk around the cities and get closer to your friends while talking to them with this road trip vibe. In the end, the game is definitely an awesome and worthy successor to Persona 5.\n\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nOn the Steam Deck however, there are a couple of issues stopping me from enjoying this game. First, the game will only run when using Proton GE, so you will need to make sure it is installed (you can follow our guide on getting it on our website). Next, while it can run at higher graphics settings, I noticed there was still some slowdown. The game can definitely hit 60 FPS, but even when set to it, it caps itself around 58. To fix this, make sure to turn Vsync off as this will push it lower.\n\nThe last one is that cutscenes will only play music, not any sound effects or voices. There is subtitles so it is still passable, but it does ruin the experience a little bit if trying to fully immerse yourself. No Proton GE layer seemed to fix this, so if you are going to play on the Steam Deck, cutscenes will be impaired.\n\nOverall, the game is still very playable and can run on the Deck, but there are some caveats. The game is a lot of fun, but with the cutscene issues, it tends to break immersion a little bit. But if you can look past this, you will find a solid experience that continues one of the best JRPGs ever made!\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]",

[/h1]\n\nAfter finishing it...I felt empty in a feeling of reflection, I put a song on while thinking about it, weeks later I managed to gather my thoughts,\u00a0AT LEAST FOR ME although the game has a linear single ending, the experience which i received of it is the following:*minor to none spoilers ahead*\n\nThis month we had Brazilian Children's Day, why am I talking about this? The overall plot revolves around the childhood trauma of two of the characters. And the way P5S\u00a0approaches the moral theme of trauma lives up to the series' legacy,\u00a0the way it handles and showcases how to deal with childhood trauma. \n\nI reminded myself, regardless of our age, we will always have an inner child, or at least memories from our childhood that profoundly influence our overall mindset. So I loved Strikers Plot, despite the switch from RPG to ARPG, I still recommend it as a good Persona game.\n\nP.S: I recommend getting the deluxe edition for older fans, the music pack\u00a0 playing in the game with all the music from the previous games in the background ringin' gave a\u00a0\u00a0little nostalgic\u00a0feeling, well worth the extra$.\u00a0\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n- Music\n- Crosswheel weapons (Rarely do you see this in games+it's in the best char=sophie)\n- Zenkichi... relatable char, it's the closest to my usual moral, it was quite an experience watching him grow... he also uses BIG SWORDS \"ZWEIHANDER\"... (literally me in the soul series)[most unique moveset ingame battles]\n\u00a0- Cooking and dialogues, the overall camping trip.\n- I liked the fact that in this persona we didn't have a villain that was purely evil, just people with twisted goals.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nGrind,grind,grind,grind,grind,grind,grind,grind... i think grind. Well...did i say grind? Oh yeah, grind!\u00a0\n\n[h1]Final note[/h1]\u00a0 \n- I would rate the story a 10/10 but the gameplay around 6/7 so I'd give it an 8 for overall fun.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858930656",

This is a shame because the sound track is awesome, the attention to detail is great, and the maps are cool. The characters are also interesting and the overarching plot is somewhat interesting.\n\nI just can't bring myself to finish this game. After completing 3 jails, I just don't have it in me to continuously repeat the same mission format over and over again.",

I'd say the only thing I wish got carried over was the Confidant system from the original Persona 5, but granted that is replaced with the Bond Level so I am in no position to complain. I'd say if you loved Persona 5, you will find a lot of enjoyment here. If you are a newbie to the series, I'd say maybe read up a little bit on the story as its a lot to take in without prior knowledge! I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes beat em' ups and JRPGs. So damn excited for Royal now that it's coming to PC, gonna waste so much time on that masterpiece as well!!",

ITS LIKE THE BEST PART HOLY SHIIIIII-\nwhen they use a remix of \"rivers in the desert\" as a prelude to the actual boss theme you know its about to be a banger. every battle theme thumps. theres new battle themes, old battle themes that are given this sexy rock remix, its wonderful. the real-world location themes are also absolute classics, everytime you go somewhere new you'll be tapping your feet for a good while. 10/10 soundtrack, brilliant time.\n\n\ntldr: if you love Persona 5, you owe it to yourself to play this one, it doesn't treat p5 Royal content as canon but youll be too invested in the game to care. the dungeons (jails?) can feel a bit sloggy at times but everything else makes up for it for the most part. 7.5/10 (presuming you've played persona 5)",

Nope, the cat won't let you do that either. I'd also prefer if enemies respawned without having to exit and re-enter the jails (dungeons).

        "content": "As a fan of both Persona 4 and 5, and (specially) Dynasty Warriors, this game is a good combination of the musou formula with the Persona's JRPG gameplay.  Its quite take a time to get a hang of the mechanic and juggle between the musou and the rpg but overall its a fun game to play\n\nEdit: So after playing the game up to near the end game, i can say that the game is very well written, i dare to say the story are better written than the original Persona 5 game, not saying Persona 5 is badly written, but P5S expand from the original game, and the new characters in this game is also good and interesting. \n\nGameplay wise like i mentioned it may need a while adapting to, and after playing for a while you maybe have a certain character that you like or hate mechanic wise because each one has different gimmick.\n\nMy only nitpicking on this is just the persona fusion... WHY WE HAVE TO LEVEL THEM TO CERTAIN LEVEL NOW??? Though this is minor problem and most of the persona can be fusioned by just the original level.\n\nOverall it is a very good experience, though to completely experience the story you HAVE to play Persona 5 first (either vanilla or Royal as it only continues the original story).",

I had absolutely no issues with bugs or crashes and my PC is pretty meh. Likewise with graphics, no issues. I don't know who came up with the default key binds though but dear God, why? Thankfully, every key can be rebind so controls are not bad. Same with controller support.\n\nOverall, I loved every moment. It's a great follow up from the original Persona 5. Strikers did well giving the series a new refreshing spin. I originally played on release on the PS4. I 100%'ed it there and with Persona 5 Royal coming to PC in a few weeks, I decided to 100% it on steam too. Highly recommended.\n",

        "content": "This game is pretty fun! As a fan of Persona 5 Royal, and having never played a hack and slash before, I thought I'd give this a go. As a preemptive warning, this game does spoil the ending of Persona 5, so play that first. Combat can get repetitive as with any game if you play it for long enough, but the Persona flair adds a lot to the combat. The only part I dislike is they bumped the SP cost of every skill in the game compared to its Royal price, and so that made it much harder to regenerate that SP, so you will need to leave dungeons pretty often. Luckily, since this is a spin-off, there's no calendar system to deal with, so it won't affect game play in any meaningful way other than a loading screen. Other people also claim that they are running into performance issues, but I've never noticed any major stuttering or lag at all, and while my PC isn't super low end, it's 100% not high end. If you're a fan of Persona 5/Royal, give this a try. If your a fan of hack and slashes, this game isn't a bad option for you either. Overall, 8/10. Little rough around the edges, but an overall fun experience",

The most likely time it will get  locked up is when engaged in large battles or when your doing really quick switching of characters or items.\n\n\n( update possible fix its running a bit more stable with disabling of the following)\n\ngo into display settings/ under graphics/ change default graphics/ turn off hardware accelerated gpu scheduling). this fixed the hanging issues with some games with denuvo running.\n\n",

        "content": "Playing Persona 5 Strikers is like spending a few hours alternating between playing Persona 5 and playing literally any Dynasty Warriors game, while binge drinking. Then you pass out, have really weird dreams in which the two games have mixed together in your head (much like the Red Bull and vodka in your stomach), and wake up in a fog of confusion and regret. That sounds like it should be kind of awesome, but it's a mess in practice... and worse, actually kind of boring. \n \nThis game is only worth it if you're a big fan of the Persona 5 characters and want to see a continuation of their story. I can't really recommend it for the gameplay itself. Like other successors to the Dynasty Warriors games, combat can be fun at first, but gets repetitive fast. Koei did a good job of making the attacks have the same flair and art style as Persona 5, but it doesn't innovate enough, or expand on the usual formula to make it feel truly unique compared to their other games. It just feels like something I've played before, while failing to be quite as satisfying. \n \nWait for a sale-- a big one-- or watch someone else's YouTube playthrough. If you're a Persona fan, combat is probably going to wind up feeling like a chore to ferry you along to the next cut scene, so give some serious consideration to spectating this game instead of playing it.",

Gameplay is pretty fun with the new style of hack-and-slash while having to traditional Persona gameplay elements. The plot was pretty good (as always) and kept me hooked on through. Music also slaps as always. A pretty solid sequel overall. (8.5/10)",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers feels like a hard game to sell, not because I didn't enjoy my time with it, but because it is a sequel game that is designed to be enjoyed by people who liked the original, but are okay with much of what made the original good being taken out.\n\nPersona 5 was my first introduction into the Persona or the larger Shin Megami Tensei franchise, and two features of the game that I deeply enjoyed were the time management and the confidants. Neither of those are present in this story sequel, which means that there are no real consequential decisions for the player to make. Perhaps due to the game taking place over the course of a Summer road trip, there is no threat of a ticking clock over the player's head. You can go to and from the Jails (this game's version of the Palaces) as much as you like, which means there is no consequence to leaving to refill your SP. Thus, the choice of risking pushing deeper into the dungeon on low SP versus leaving early at the cost of time doesn't exist anymore.\n\nThe confidants are replaced by the BOND upgrade tree, which focuses on the friendship you build with the other Phantom Thieves throughout the game. It's as fine as any other upgrade tree in any modern game, but unlike Persona 5 the choices you make don't really matter. You'll have almost everything by the end of the game outside of the raw stat boosts and the biggest additions to it will come from events that happen during the main plot anyway. The confidants added side stories that you were incentivized to see through to the end on top of getting interesting new abilities. BOND is just lacking by comparison.\n\nBut, with that said, as somebody who likes action RPGs I still had fun playing the game. It does a good job of making Persona's combat fit into an action system, with trash enemies being easy to dispatch with some attack strings, but the actual demons requiring you to take advantage of their weaknesses to dispatch them efficiently. Naturally there are less playable characters here than a regular Musou game would have, but they all have their unique quirks that make them fun to play in their own right. The story is interesting enough, even if it does start to feel a little like a rehash towards the end. It should be noted that the story of Strikers follows the original ending for Persona 5, and not the ending of Royal. The music is as great as ever, although part of that is due to the game using remixes of certain songs from the original Persona 5 (Counter Strike and Daredevil are absolutely bangers though).\n\nThe game also ran on my Windows 10 PC with no problems whatsoever. It's always nice to play a PC game that doesn't waste your time with having to fix it, or having to wait for the developers to patch it to an acceptable state. It just worked.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you're desperate for one last adventure with the Phantom Thieves, don't mind going from a turn-based battle system to a realtime action one and don't mind the loss of confidants or the time management, then you'll have a good time here.\n\nRecommended",

        "content": "Niche game for Persona 5 fans that likes Hack&Slash or just accept gameplay suffering for the MAIN story. Can't recommend to anyone who doesn't complete at least P5. H&S mechanics are fine, but I didn't like them (still better then dancing games). Game definitely lacks polishing and not on par as P5R. Mapping multiple actions on a same button will take you in unwanted situations at least a few times per game, Vertical gameplay just purely bad implements with slow camera, jumps and ropes.\nFighting are OK, but pre-combat scenes are fucked: you enter an empty room, Futaba calls that it's clear on here radars and enemy just raises from nothing and starts talking to you. Why? Just shut-up and fight me, ok? We both know that we can't talk this out. This happens so often that you will get in a big empty room knowing that an enemy will be there. This annoys me from the start and till the end.\nI didn't like \"original\" P5 remix soundtrack from the start. I bought Legacy BGM pack just to add more battle music and don't listen to this. Only after late mid game I get involved with a music because it starts sync with scenes and story. I wished for at least original P5 soundtrack, but you will get it only after completing the game and I'm not going in that rabbit hole again.\nStory are good, mostly predictable with a few twists. Sideguest (aka requests) are awful: kill, obtain, secure, crawl. It's just boring grind after fully-featured sidequests introduces in P5 with good entertaining stories. Just skip them, it's not worth it. You can buy a lot of stuff in a shop.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the rare kind of game that's able to both feel like a pleasant surprise and a tremendous disappointment rolled up into the one package, and it certainly makes for an interesting experience to think about. There isn't even really an element present here that feels wholly great or wholly terrible either, it's a balancing act where every idea is on the cusp of either entirely falling off the deep end or being something truly inspired that gets the game as a whole to stand out from the original Persona 5. I'd even go as far as saying that if this game were about 10 hours shorter that I'd think it was an outright great little time, but as it stands, the longer things went on, the more the initially small flaws would build up until it created something that I barely could bother finishing.\n\nTransforming Persona 5's core combat from the more traditional turn based combat into a musou was definitely a creative decision that I was initially concerned about since there have been so many instances where a lot of the strategy a game could have ends up getting removed in favour of button mashing, but it's honestly the thing I think Strikers ended up doing the best as I went on. Despite being a musou by definition, with the hack n slash combat paired with waves of usually very weak enemies, I was impressed by just how much of the dynamics of Persona were still present. While the basic hacking and sladhing will get you through a lot of the smaller encounters, against anything with even a hint of challenge to it, it immediately feels as if it plays a bit closer to a real time Persona rather than a standard game of the genre, with careful team building and full exploitation of enemy weaknesses both playing a huge role in getting you to the stage where you can take things down. To still provide such a strong incentive to be spending like, 20 minutes at a time in the velvet room to minmax your team and make that time feel worth it is very cool to do when the gameplay style takes such a sharp turn and it leads to some situations that really do feel frenetic, yet rewarding.\n\nThis is especially true for the boss fights, which were consistently some of the best parts here, often being on the far more tanky side of things, but always feeling as if they properly took advantage of the genre shift and all made for some engaging and intense fights that would more often than not come down to the wire, the final boss especially mixing things up in clever ways that I won't spoil. Adding those additional flashy moves that could be kited around was also a good move in making the choice to move in this direction feel warranted and meaningful while providing another avenue to provide some additional spectacle to things, keeping up with the theme of everything about Persona 5 being so incredibly flashy. That said, things aren't quite perfect either with the shift in style, with certain ideas getting lost in the process. MP conservation might as well not be a thing considering how much more health everything seems to have in this, you're going to either be staying at full MP or blowing it all in a single bigger fight, and it hinders such a core strategic element that could've been fixed just by giving the party way more or it instead of making it a resource that was even more finite than it was in the original game.\n\nThe dungeon design was also really bad for the most part, starting off with a couple that were really fun in one way or another, albeit pretty bland from a layout standpoint, but as things went on, rather than building upon concepts that were established and knowing when to add a little twist to them to elevate the experience to the next level, it just was more of the same, but more of it, and far more formulaic. This reached a peak with the 6th dungeon, which was a genuinely agonising experience because of how much unadulterated tedium was thrown towards the player. This sense of repetition carries over to the narrative as well, as while I love the vibes of the phantom thieves going on a road trip and saving the world in the process, after a certain point it becomes increasingly obvious just how many story beats have just been taken from the original and veeeerrry slightly retooled, just with character writing that feels far heavier on the tropes.\n\nIn general there's a certain impersonal feel to how a lot of the narrative is executed, villains that are barely connected with the protagonists in any way beyond vague similarities in their strife, everyone just doing their own thing and happening to cross paths along the way, and basically any other interaction outside of the main cast. While this definitely works in some instances to make the world feel more alive and not something that entirely revolves around the protagonists, it quickly leads to wishing that the game would've at least used this in a more creative way at the very least. These 2nd hand stories of hardship and trauma you hear throughout are obviously still pretty dark and all, but without basically any contextualisation to these beyond the bare minimum, it ends up leaving a very minimal impact in comparison and makes it hard to truly get invested in the antagonists throughout, often feeling explicitly introduced to cause conflict without any other purpose.\n\nThe lack of this personal element extends out to the rest of the game too, gone is the sense of proper time progression and planning, instead replaced with the game's date exclusively moving forward when the plot demands it rather than leaving any leniency for one of the best aspects of the original game. Things just have nowhere near as much of a comfy charm when you're not spending a lot of your time just, living life and chatting with characters, and not only are all the side characters from the original not present at all, but the social links or any equivalent are also missing. All of this is replaced with this one bar called the \"bond bar\" which is just an artificial way of trying to evoke the same feelings without putting in any of the elements that elevated this, and like so many other elements just feels like it was included to keep up the surface level similarities. Funnily enough though, despite all my complaints, a lot of this only started becoming truly detrimental near the end once things began to outstay their welcome, and even amongst this painful end portion, the final boss was still a really great time and there were a few other isolated elements of greatness mixed in, not to mention that the game was almost as stylish as the original, albeit less polished.\n\nI genuinely feel like if you're more used to games on the longer side of things that you'll get more out of this than I did, as I'll admit that I do begin running out of patience after a certain point and it probably makes some of the issues present here feel even worse than they are in reality. Still won't affect my own opinion, but I could definitely see others enjoying this more than me as a result. If you're a big fan of Persona 5 and are fine with a bit of repetitiveness, I could definitely recommend this, it still maintains a very high amount of P5's identity while taking things in a different direction. It's not perfect, but you get to see more Phantom Thieves in action and Haru finally is able to get a reasonable amount of screentime too, and that stuff combined with the surprisingly fun combat ends up making this an alright time even if I personally ended up feeling pretty disappointed and bored towards the end.\n\n6.5/10 - Recommended but only if you're a pretty big fan of the OG Persona 5 and wait for it to go on sale",

        "content": "After coming from Royal, the story felt kind of predictable and unsatisfysing, but that's not to say it's bad. I still had plenty of fun discovering the story behind the jails and the 2 new party members, but that was never the reason why I played the game as much as I did.\nThe best part of this game is definitely the combat. The satisfying nature or the combos, the insane nuance of the movement and master arts, and the adjustment of the persona mechanics all combine to create an extremely sturdy gameplay cycle with a very high skill ceiling for each of the 8 playable characters.\nover the course of the base game, even in hard difficulty I rarely felt like the challenge gave the combat enough justice, but merciless difficulty was a whole different story. Being NG+ exclusive, of course merciless would be difficult but holy shit, some of the bosses put dark souls to shame (although i would've liked the boss to not take an hour and a half).\nI can't put all my thoughts into this one review because steam won't let me, so I'll conclude with my recommendation: you should play base P5 before this but it isn't a requirement, hard mode is the only difficulty with any challenge until NG+, and if the combat hooked you then I'd highly recommend merciless, but this game is best enjoyed with full context and played at your own pace.\n10/10",

Unfortunately, I'm not sure I have the patience or time for the long-time gameplay of the actual games, so I've been reluctant to try the actual game for myself and settled with watching the (long) cutscene movies on YouTube. So when I heard about Persona 5 Strikers, and found out that it was very different in terms of gameplay from the traditional Persona games, I decided to give it a shot AND LOVED IT!\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is great for Persona fans that don't quite have the time or patience for the usual gameplay of Persona games.",

        "content": "This was a drag to play through, so much unnecessary dialogue and down time. Its a huge turn off from the exceedingly fun fast pace hack n slash and then cut to 3 - 10 minutes of dialogues at each checkpoint.\n\nThe writing is not great either, no character development for any of the past members and cheap forced sympathy for the villains. There was tons of needless dialogue, dialogue that could've been summed up in a sentence. Instead they make like 3-5 members of the phantom thieves to give some sort of dialogue reaction like \"we're stuck\", \"oh no\", \"what are we going to do\". But to give credit where its due, Zenkichi's arc and Sophia's are my favourite standouts. \n\nGameplay is fun, the typical 'Warriors' type combat with Persona element mixed in and provided mindless enjoyment. The Jails (Dungeons) are linear, boring and mixed with the unnecessary forced dialogue at each checkpoint. It gave this dynamic of clearing enemies for fun and then cut to boring dialogue that last for minutes. The Jails were visually appealing but annoying to play through with lots of backtracking and downtime like unnecessary dialogue and defending Futuba for 3 minutes to move to the next area. The bossfights were fun though, each one had their own mechanic that provided decent challenge and having the option to fight them again.\n\nThis is not a must play game, at best your looking at a Marvel movie level of enjoyment in this game. Its no masterpiece and I believe anyone who enjoyed Persona 5 can skip this game.\n\nEdit: *There is no ultrawide support.*",

Of course, style and polish are the forte of the game. Everything from finisher animations to menu UI is a pleasure to experience.

        "content": "Slow start aside, this is what I wanted from Persona 5. \nI thought the original game was good but very flawed in matters of story, characters and setting. Some of the themes just never connected, the social links varied wildly in how good they were (most got ruined by including boss fights in the end), and overall the story and villains felt weak, cartoonish, and juvenile.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a do-over. After the second dungeon the game opens up and goes mask-off about being  P5 without the rewrites and crunch to finish. And it's *really* good at being Persona 5. I now enjoy this side of the franchise way more, love all the characters and would be super down to see them again.\n\nAdded to being a superior telling of P5's story, it's also just a great action game. It's not perfect, some mechanics could have used some polishing, but I had a blast with it. I really really beg of you to continue after the second castle -- it is the weakest part of the game and could be completely taken out and it wouldn't change much. Game starts from the third castle onward and never lets up. \n\nI'd recommend this to anyone who kinda enjoyed P5, and people who want a cool action game to spend a long time with.",

Unfortunately for me I ran out of shadow-ass in about 2 minutes....\n\nIt's an amazing game with a really solid story and characters just like all the Persona games.

The fact they released a sequel to a game that wasn't on PC annoyed me more then I thought it would. This game isn't bad by any means. The new battle system is very nice but the lack of the \"Slice of Life\" part of the original game does kind of make it less fun. They give you some \"Choices\" but they aren't nearly the depth as the original game. If on sale I'd recommend it just to continue on with the characters from Persona 5. Good hack and slash. Good visual. Just missing that Depth. Now give us Persona 5 Royal",

        "content": "Not quite the masterpiece as its predecessor, but a solid sequel. The combat gets pretty nuts, you fight ridiculous amounts of enemies dynasty warriors style, but there is plenty of variety and strategy to it. Excellent boss fights! And naturally the soundtrack slaps too because Shoji Meguro. The one huge flaw it does have is the story takes like 1/3rd of the game to actually get interesting. But even with the weak story early on it's still fun, and the story does get really good(albeit being a bit too similar to the original). The cast is mostly the original P5 characters(sadly no Kasumi here...) with a couple excellent new ones added in like Zenkichi and Sophia. \n\nFinal verdict, 8/10.",

        "content": "If you like Persona, you might like this game. If you don't particularly like Persona, though, you won't find a good Warriors/Musou game here, and if you aren't that familiar with Persona's gameplay mechanics, you also won't find a helpful introduction to them here. Incidentally, I don't have notifications on, so I don't really care if you agree or not; I'm being honest, as a big fan of Musou and someone who vastly prefers other MegaTen spin-offs.\n\nRyuji is one of the only remotely sympathetic characters, and most of the rest are varying degrees of awful and insufferable. Naturally, the one kind of likeable character gets treated like dirt by most of the rest of them. Not that they have much empathy for any other living thing, however, as evidenced by Yuusuke's insane soliloquy near the end of the second venue. This also ironically tries to make the others seem like good friends, even though that's never once evident in the game itself.\n\nNot that they miss any opportunity to talk, at length, about everything. Sometimes it's kind of charming and can even be a little helpful, in battle when one might mention the weakness of an enemy. Most of the time, it's something you want to fast-forward through or skip. You have multiple options in most conversations you're involved in, but you usually only get to chime in once or twice, and it doesn't really matter what you say that much, either. It \"but thou must!\"s all the way. Most of the time, if you get a few options, it's \"horrible person\", \"more plausibly deniable but still horrible\", and \"seems sensible but skews horrible-ish thanks to the railroading happening in most of the game\".\n\nOne of the game's best parts is how it creates some interesting places to see and fills them with things to do. Unfortunately, it doesn't really immerse you in the location, aside from some superficial traits, and the areas you can walk around in are extremely small. You seem unable to revisit places you've been, aside from the tiresome and fairly homogenous jail/palace/whatever they're calling them environments, which isn't really that exciting. Most of the layouts of these places are confusing, but not in a challenging or fun way, and the themes end up looking a lot alike, so it becomes easy to get disoriented. You'll also probably not be able to finish one in a single attempt, and additionally, some enemies give no indication of how powerful they are, so you might mop the floor with them, or they might one-shot you, which is super fun, let me tell you.\n\nYou also can't just pause and exit the game if you get yourself into a fight you either don't want to finish or know you're going to lose, so you have to just shut it down instead. This discourages you from ever taking any risks or exploring, which seems to be a poor decision in game design. Sometimes things happen that are either impossible to avoid, despite what the game indicates, or just not well explained and thus annoying, like the invisible platforms, which I regard as one of the laziest things in any game.\n\nOther elements, like the shallow cooking one and local cuisine, are intriguing at first, but most of the dishes are the most disgusting trash anyone could ask for. Half of the recipes I found were of things that even the most Japanese of friends either can't stand or never eat. Most of the truly appealing fare was barely touched upon at this local shop or that, if it appeared at all. That's a shame. You're also forced to make a batch of truly gross curry and they attempt to bully you into making it again. But not to worry, the cooking element is mostly optional...mostly. It does seem a shame, though, to have such a potentially useful thing end up being so distasteful in so many ways.\n\nThe biggest problem with it being a Musou/Warriors game is that it doesn't play like one, and it isn't fun even for just that. It takes ages to get through sections because the characters won't shut up and keep having cutscenes that you can't skip through, which means you are constantly losing all momentum. You're also expected to try and be stealthy, which is already an element I dislike in most games, but it could randomly decide you're not being stealthy enough and throw you into a fight via cutscene or unexplained gameplay mechanic shenanigans. Add to this the fact that most items you find in a dungeon are literally garbage, and it's very hard to recommend this game to anyone but someone who dearly loves the Persona series and can't get enough of the characters. Even that kind of person might be put off though, because the gameplay is unlike both Persona and Warriors games enough that it is often frustrating for all the wrong reasons. Add to that the fact that the difficulty settings are just a lie, and it's really hard to keep coming back.",

It feels like Atlus genuinely wanted to tell a brand new story to people everywhere, one filled with emotions and difficult topics as usual, using their most recent (and most popular) world to do it, because Atlus loves their franchise as much as the fandom does. Strikers has just as much heart and soul as the original P5 did, and you can FEEL it in every mile of this road trip of a lifetime.\nIf you're still apprehensive, let it be known: it's easy to figure out the new combat system, the new characters and story are all wonderful, and our beloved Phantom Thieves are just as stylish+hilarious+wholesome as ever;)",

        "content": "I highly recommend Persona 5 Strikers to any Persona 5 fan, even if you are not familiar with musou games at all. Here is a list of things you might want to know before jumping in: \n\n1)  It is strongly advised to complete original Persona 5 prior to starting this game. Strikers is a direct sequel that draws heavily upon P5, which implies that a) many scenes require familiarity with the story and characters of P5 to fully appreciate, and b) If you have not played Persona 5, Strikers will contain a lot of major spoilers. \n\n2) Beating the Royal version of Persona 5 before Strikers is not required. Apart from a (damn good) battle music track which unlock after completing the main story of Strikers, there are no references to content that Royal adds on top of the original P5. \n\n3) Social links and time management are absent. However, the story contains numerous social scenes, most of which are great. In addition, there will be some optional opportunities to hang out with your friends in certain cities you visit.\n\n4) The story itself is pretty good. Characters are great: new ones receive significant development, while every returning member of Persona 5 cast gets their fair share of moments to shine. \n\n5) Combat happens in real time with time freezing while summoning persona or shooting a gun. However, it features a pretty good implementation of certain key elements from turn-based combat of the original P5: the importance of a diverse persona roster, SP management, buffs and debuffs; weakness system and all-out attacks; various types of technical hits; quirks of different healing spells. Apart from using skills for SP, every persona has its own set of skills which are cast as finishers of various combo moves. To top that off, each teammate has a collection of unique features that personalize their approach to battle. All of this adds up to a very fun, addictive and fluid system, where people with prior knowledge of P5 combat can gain a solid foothold right away. \n\n6) Fusion system is more restrictive, but I still had fun with it. There are much fewer personae in compendium, and each of them has a very limited number of fusion recipes. In addition, some of those recipes require parent persona to be at least of a certain level. However, the game allows you to increase the level of a persona by spending persona points (earned by fusion, releasing personae or collecting personae from battle when your stock is full), so no tedious grinding is necessary to meet those requirements. It's still possible to create really powerful combinations, but now you have to think harder about the way of passing all the skills you want to the target persona. Thankfully, skills cards exist. \n\n7) Dungeons are fun to explore. Apart from distinct visuals, each one has some gameplay or level design features that give it a unique feel. Stealth is the same as it was in P5: simplistic and satisfying. Also, now you can use environmental objects in battle, which is really cool and often powerful.\n\n8) Visuals are stylish as always, and soundtrack is a blast. \n\n9) Completing the main story, all side quests, beating all optional bosses and unlocking New Game + took me approximately 60 hours. Almost no grinding was involved, and I had a lot of fun the entire time (except for a single battle).",

I played persona 5 a d I am pretty much the main character but in real life , so I decided to do things he did to make friends/girlfriends. I started by making a social link chart and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside. I'm pretty far in my social links with the girls in the apartment next door probably 6/7 with both of them . I left them a calling card too to let them know I was going to steal their hearts I know in the game if you date multiple girls is bad but I have until valentine's Day to figure that out. Discord servers are like mementos where I can dive and debate with people until I improve the worldview of that server that's like public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too . When I get 100% I think they'll give me mod on the server",

In reality, however, the simple but engaging real-time combat of Persona 5 Strikers is structured much closer to action-JRPGs like Kingdom Hearts, barely resembling a musou game at all.\n\nSo this game, it\u2019s good, great story, and it is much more than a button masher. It beautifully blends rpg action with hack and slash combat. The music is great as always. The only problem I have with this game is most of the time, there\u2019s too much dialogue but I got over it after like the third conversation. The villains are also great. There\u2019s a lot of exploration! Overall, great game. Considering this game is like warriors we could possibly have a few crossover characters and that would be cool, considering they did a crossover with Hatsune Miku in Persona 4 Dancing All Night which was a nice addition to the game.\n10/10",

        "content": "Pretty fun, but the grind for the bond exp trophy is a terrible slog that I'm in the midst of. Other than that, my only other complaint is that my Xbox controller is very particular when it comes to this game. You have to wait to connect the controller until the game is running. If you don't, the game will bug out and constantly switch the button icons from Xbox to PS and the button mapping gets funky.\n\nThat aside, this game was a good experience. You'll want to have played P5 or P5R in order to fully grasp the story. The combat was difficult to grasp at first, but after a few hours I got the hang of it, especially after I figured out how to get my controller to work with the game. \n\nWith that being said, I doubt I'll come back to this game after I get all of the achievements for it, or at least not any time soon. It's a great game, and the mainline Persona games are probably my favorite video games of all time, but it doesn't really hold a candle to the mainline games. Most of the enjoyment I got from this game was just getting more Phantom Thieves content.",

        "content": "Ayyyye, I'm back again with another review...I know, I know, who goes from Travis Strikes Again to Persona 5 Strikers? I don't know, I'm just wack with my taste, I guess. Still working on The Silver Case too, and I'm almost done with [i] that [/i] game too. Anyways, it's showtime!:\n\n[h1] The Narrative/Story [/h1]\n\nWell...it's a lot like Persona 5's original story (whether it be Vanilla or Royal, doesn't matter cause they both segway into Strikers.) This time around, you've travelling all around Japan and saving the world once again! Everyone gets their own moments to shine in the story again, which is nice and we do see the development from P5 show up here. It's hard to really comment on as it really just boils down to the Phantom Thieves (along with a couple of members, one of which is unironically one of the best parts about the game.) \n\nThe locations chosen work with the story and the pacing and writing were fine, better than Vanilla 5's writing in my opinion. I think the themes that felt a little tacked on in the original are either written better here or the new themes (like family issues in Haru's case, not going into any spoilers) are decently enough written. The entire of the game....mehhh...it's kinda cheesy, maybe I'm just used to the Persona formula of having happy but sad endings, but it still had me invested through the end.\n\nI'll give it either a A-/B+, it's alright. Not the best writing in the world, but far from the worst...trust me...I'm...not so fond of some of P3's writing in particular, but we'll save that for when Persona 3 Portable gets ported to PC sometime next year...\n\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n\nProbably the best aspect about this game. Being a Muso game (and having played Hyrule Warriors on Wii U a long time ago), I actually really enjoyed this game's gameplay. Sure, after a while, it gets a bit repetitive, but upgrading you and your party members as well as mastering new skills by just doing combos and whatnot freshens the game up a bit, not to mention you're [i] always [/i] getting new Personas and strengthening them, getting them new skills just like in normal P5. A lot of the mechanics carried over quite well to this game and in my opinion, this is one of the best Muso games I've played (which isn't saying much because again, I've only played Hyrule Warriors before this game that was back when the game came out.)\n\nThe only issue I have with it is that if you like doing side content, getting some of the [i] really [/i] good demons and having the best equipment possible for everyone like me, you'll have to do quite a bit of grinding for money and Persona Points (PP for short...kind of an really overused term in RPGs if you ask me.) I'd say it's mostly worth it get to awesome Personas like Yoshitsune, Alice, and Mara and with the ability to pitch which skills to inherit when fusing, skill-swapping for Joker's Personas any time in overworld in the Persona menu, and a constant flow of new Personas, grinding shouldn't be too bad, I'd say money's the biggest issue and even then there's ways around it. So I guess the only complaint I have with it asides from it potential repetitiveness is that it's a little grindy, especially towards the end.\n\nA-, it's pretty solid stuff and I'm genuinely surprised how the mechanics from Persona/SMT carried over into a Hack N' Slash as well as they did here.\n\n[h1] The Visual/Audio Design [/h1]\n\n[i] *Sigh* [/i] Yeah... this is one of the weaker parts of this game. Let me get the graphics out of the way first, though.\n\nVisually, the game looks great! The overworlds are nice and detailed and look great without suffering any performance issues (which surprises me quite a bit given that I've heard Muso games usually have pretty bad PC ports or at least mediocre ones that have their issues) and the effects like the ones seen on the Personas is nice. The menu, while not [i] as [/i] stylish as P5's original menus are still pretty nice here and definitely have their own flair and are relatively easy to navigate (minus the menu before the final boss which was...kind of clunky.) I really can't complain about anything visually with the game, the models are all nice, the FMVs both pre-rendered and animated are quite nice and the game looks pretty good for game that was on Switch and PS4 originally (the former suffering pretty badly from framerate issues from what I've heard.) Point is, it looks good, Atlus did great with this game's visually just as I'd expect them to.\n\nNow the audio....uhhh...well...it's not great. Let's start with the voice-acting. I kinda feel like a few of the cast members forgot how to do their original character's voices, Ryuji sounded kinda off here and there especially and so did Joker, and some of the other character's actual audio sounds quieter or louder than others which is also kind of distracting. You can definitely tell this game was recorded during COVID while the everyone was at home, but they certainly tried and to be fair, the further along the game goes everyone sounded just fine again, so I guess it was just a few lines from everyone that got a little messed up. The acting for the new characters were perfect! Loved Zenkichi's VA's performance especially, he absolutely nailed the character and really made the banter between the Thieves lively. Sophia's...fine too, I can't really say anything about her without going into spoilers, but she did fine with her roll too. A- stuff, if only because of the few lines that could've been re-recorded to sound better and...not forcing people to record from home and just have them socially distance and record in a studio, it is what is, though.\n\nAs for the music...well...I was told not to use the default music and to just use the Persona BGM DLC I'd bought with my Deluxe Edition I got about a year ago (...yeah, this game's been on my backlog for A WHILE now...and the other DLC is kinda whatever, I used it for the beginning of the game and never used it again, so it kinda felt like a waste, I forgot to mention that in gameplay, but whatever) and while I enjoyed the DLC music being there for Persona 1-4, the other music was okay too, nothing special and it got a little repetitive hearing the same few battle songs over and over again, but there's some original music in here (namely Daredevil) which are absolutely [i] banging [/i] tunes. I'd say the overall OST excluding the DLC music is a B+, it's alright, there's some good songs in there, but [i] a lot [/i] of the music was reused from OG P5, which is a little...I guess lame.\n\n[h1] The Verdict/Conclusion [/h1]\n\nWhile this game does have its issues of being a little grindy and being a little repetitive, it's a nice companion piece to P5 that I'm sure anyone would played the original game (and also likes Muso games and or Hack N' Slashes) will enjoy. I'd give it around a 7.5-8.0/10, nothing spectacular, but a solid game that kept me invested til the end. If you've got like 70 hours to spare like I did (I idled for some of my hours to get to 93.1, don't always believe my hours, Yakuza 0 and Kiwami 1 were also botched in that regard), then go for it.\n\nOh, but here's one piece of advice [b] PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE. WAIT FOR A SALE. [/b] Yes, I know this game's only a year old, but that doesn't excuse it for being overpriced (especially with the DLC like...really? $10 for a BGM pack, jeez man. Meanwhile, Atlus is STILL pulling this kind of stuff with Nocturne HD Remaster and more atrociously and recently with Soul Hackers 2...which I'm not gonna even bother buying until it goes on sale because 1. I still wanna play the original and 2. I don't want pay $100+ for a new game, that's just ridiculous.), it's a good game, but not $60 good, $30 maybe at most.\n\nWell, if you're still up for it despite that, then it's showtime!\n\n\n[h1] Post-Review Ramble [/h1]\n\nSo uhhh...yeah. Hoping to finish The Silver Case soon and [i] that [/i] game's gonna be a fun one to review...just you wait...",

        "content": "P5R ON PC OUR DREAMS HAVE COME TRUE\n\nClickbait \u2018title\u2019 aside, Persona 5 Strikers is for sure worth your time coming off either vanilla P5 or P5R. A subtle hint I like about this game is the lack of confidants/social links, with the new BOND system taking its place. It says all the individual bonds between Joker and the rest of the regularly scheduled Phantom Thieves are as \u2018maxed\u2019 as much as possible, being more about enjoying the experiences of their trip around Japan and becoming a tighter group overall as opposed to the compartmentalized substories SLs tend to be. \n\nZenkichi and Sophia are also great additions with great character arcs, the former reminding me of previous Hierophant Arcana characters and their respective daughters, but this one being something the Phantom Thieves have an active, prolonged hand in that makes it feel very believable and relatable. Sohpia is a bit more predictable of an AI gaining sentience, but she still has a very heartwarming personality and conclusion. They both remind me quite a bit of Takuto Maruki, may Billy Kametz rest in piece. \n\nAs someone who has never played a Dynasty Warriors game, I have to say the combination of action and turn based combat from both series is put together seamlessly and the moment to moment gameplay flows perfectly. Baton passing and showtimes really make you feel like working as a team has true benefits and each interaction really brings each PT\u2019s character out, my favorite showtime being Zenkichi\u2019s. \n\nSo yeah, P5S is a great addition to the Persona series, even if a full $60 is a bit steep coming off 120+ hours from Royal. I\u2019d conclude it calling it a very heartwarming experience, that\u2019s the feeling I got from my time with it if I had to describe it in one word. Great straightforward story that lets us see our favorite delinquents again and seamless gameplay that is punchy, cathartic and as stylish and over-the-top as ever. (And of course 10/10 music, especially randomized music from all past mainline Persona games, good one Atlus.)",

        "content": "My hours are elevated due to leaving it on when not playing. I originally played about 40 hours.  I wanted to like it...........I really did. However, there are some very \"meh\" aspects. First of which is the predictability in the flow of the game. Travel to new place, eat, find a new jail and liberate people, travel again......wash rinse and repeat. I suppose those things would be fine if they weren't each so shallow.  Each new area/place requires an investigation phase. This would simply mean talking to a few npcs..........and boom! Investigation is complete. The eating phase is simply the characters raving for about 2-3 minutes about what foods to eat in the area. This means nothing to you, the player, or to the story. It's done by cut-scenes. Ultimately it feels like a lot of the dialogue during this phase is just rehashed over and over. One character is excited about a certain food, and other characters mention alternatives.  The next issue is...............\n\nThe predictability of the issues surrounding the monarchs. Several of the monarchs have ties to members of your party, but it's not done in an interesting way. What's more, it follows the unfortunate pattern in anime-like games where it feels like every character has to say their \"piece\" regarding to a situation, and it's really not necessary........especially when they are just agreeing with each other in different words. \n\nThe gameplay is simplistic and while it may seem really cool about creating and improving new personas..........you will eventually start to lose enthusiasm despite multiple new personas being available at each level. Why? Because you will notice that the move-sets are the same as other personas and that the stats really don't vary that much when within 10 levels of each other. \n\nThe leveling is broken when you can earn as much experiance and more money in the beginning area of the 2nd jail than you can by the time you  can enter the 5th jail. The beginning area of the 2nd jail is one of the few areas where enemies respawn (including a near-500 exp enemy). Just continue to let yourself get detected and maintain it around the 30%-90% and go after the crystal enemy each time you hear it on the map.  The crystal enemy also gives about 500 exp. You can get up to a million yen in about an hour and level up quicker than most areas. \n\nUltimately, after the 4th jail and seeing everything start to repeat again on the 5th location/jail.........I just gave up and youtube-ed the ending.  Save your money. At least with Persona 5 there was a better overall story and had a dating aspect.",

Using Mosou mode with persona skills is special. Risky mode is quite challenging. I don't suppose it ended the story in emotional way. Maybe i'm really get into the game so i moved to tears while the ending. Really enjoy this game.",

It is still a hell of a lot of fun though. The combat against mobs can get old but the boss fights (of which there are plenty) are where the combat really shines and shows how excellent it is.\n\nThe story is a sequel to P5R and while the main narrative isn't nearly as engaging as the previous game's story (though still fun), the characters, both returning and new are just as excellent as always. They are what make the Persona 5 games so memorable and fun and they really shine here - P5R was their origin story and P5S is them getting to go on a new adventure already knowing each other. \n\nAnd that MUSIC...this soundtrack is amazing yall. Hard to not wanna punch something in the face when Daredevil starts playing.\n\nI will be saving my remaining side content (which is mostly just extra boss battles and finishing the persona registry) for a NG+ run down the road, but I am eager to return to this game sometime. \n",

I feel like you can skip main-line Persona 5 going into this as long as you have played one of the other games, such as Persona 4, so that you'll have a general understanding of the concepts. playing Persona 5 before this sure would have added more backstory to these specific characters but I don't feel it is required. \n\nIf you are a fan of the music in other Persona games this is more of the same, in a good way\n\n\nIn Closing, please bring this entire franchise to the PC because you will have all my dollars",

But, it fits the visual style of the predecessor Persona 5 perfectly. Also, playing P5 first is recommended, it contains the entire main cast and follows after the events of P5. Multiple story references to P5 too\n\nMusic and Visuals are A+ like you're used to\nFusion system like in the Persona series, but with roughly half as many Personas and skills.\nPlayable characters have different combat styles: buffing, fast/slow, status effects, etc.\nStory is similar to P5, writing quality is on par with most fanfiction. But, 90% voiced with great voice acting! Also in Japanese with English subtitles.\n\nMust buy for SMT fans. Also recommended for fans of Nier/DMC action games. If you're neither, check out some gameplay footage!",

I finished Persona 5 (2 times), Persona 4, I've played Dancing in the past, and I'm currently playing Q and 3.\n\nI CANNOT recommend this game. I am not a fan of Dynasty Warrior themed games. However, the problem goes beyond that. I didn't feel any... heart and soul in this spinoff. It just feels empty. I love the cities, they're beautifully designed and animated but... The dialogue isn't getting with me. It feels like dialogue that was created by an AI just for the sake of rushing out a half-baked story. The heroes don't feel like they're emotionally tied to the villains like they were in Persona 5, and beyond that? The villains just simply aren't interesting to begin with. It feels like they were just thrown into the mix for the sake of combat instead of them having a place in the story.\n\nThe perfect description for this game is generic. It's just not good, in my opinion. I found myself skipping through dialogue, and even skipping cutscenes. Cutscenes! I've never skipped anything in a Persona game prior to this game! A single sentence can easily sum up what was drug out through pages upon pages of generic, filler-like dialogue. And speaking of being drug out, I feel like this whole game is drug out through and through. As I got closer to the end of the game, I found myself wanting more and more for it to be over, groaning as I discovered 2 extra jails past what I believed to be the final boss.\n\nI will say this - this is the most advanced Dynasty Warrior themed game out there. And with that being said... It still manages to be a boring, repetitive slog in terms of gameplay. The combat is just X, with a few Y's thrown into the mix for a petty amount of combos you can do. The combat, in reality, just becomes spamming whatever ~Ma move hits everybody's weakness.\n\nToday, I'm gonna FORCE myself to finish this game, just for the sake of uninstalling it to free up space on my computer. Yeah, you heard that right, force. You should NEVER have to force yourself to finish a game, it means it just straight up isn't a fun/good game. It just feels like such a slog... As a person who literally completed New Game and New Game + of P5R back to back with no break, I'm heavily disappointed with this spinoff - and if I could... honestly? I'd refund it. I hope the next spinoff will be better.\n\nEdit: I was so bored playing this that ultimately \"forcing myself to play it today\" turned into forcing myself to play it spread out through a period of a few days. It's that boring to me.",

        "content": "P5S is a good Hack-and-Slash that can be enjoyed by any players, be it existing Persona fans or new players.\n\nP5S is a direct continuation from the base game, Persona 5, but can be enjoyed even without experiencing the base game itself. This allows Persona fans to enjoy the story continuing from its original ending, but also allow for new players, experiencing the Persona series for the first time, to enjoy the game. The story isn't anything too great but is good enough for an enjoyable experience. The story is very linear, meaning the choices made by your character will have no impact towards the endings. The dialogue options only affects how the other characters will respond and could make for some funny interactions between characters. The character interactions are great and provides lots of humorous and some badass moments.\n\nThe gameplay is where it truly deviates from the usual Persona Series. All previous installations of the Persona franchise (Not including spinoffs like Arena or the Dancing games) were mainly Turn-Based JRPG, but P5S is a Hack and Slash. \nThis makes the game more fast-paced and action packed but could be a turn off for those who enjoy the strategy of Persona games. \n\nP5S is also significantly shorter as compared to the other Persona games. It took me 40+ hrs to clear the base game and could easily be cleared in a shorter amount of time as I took the time to do every requests and search every nook and cranny of each jail. Also there is still New Game+ to play which could easily take me an additional 20hrs or so. Making the total game time to be around 50-60hrs.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a solid 7/10. Gameplay is good but certain parts felt repetitive (especially farming Persona Points to fuse certain Personas in the later part of the game). Story was pretty so-so but the character interactions were great. I would recommend buying this game on a sale for anyone who enjoys Hack-and-Slash or are Persona Fans.\n\nEDIT: Took me an additional 25hrs to complete all achievements. Have yet to complete NG+ playthrough, but doubt I would finish it. It is still a fun game to me but to 100% it did not feel as fun as just completing the game on the first run. It lacked the replayability that all base Persona games have but the challenge that Merciless posed in the early stages of NG+ was indeed quite challenging. However, once you fused a few max stats Personas, the game becomes quite a breeze and just knowing how to use Status Ailments and Technical to your advantage to wipe through most bosses relatively easily. This does not change my rating of it as to 100% a game is more of a perfectionist or if the game is really one of your favorites. In my case, its just that I really enjoy the Persona series and just wanted to 100% it as I wait for other Persona ports that.",

        "content": "If you liked Persona 5 you will love this game. I loved the game and only had minor issues with it. One being that the side mission requests can get very repetitive and boring especially at the end as you do the same things over and over again and get a ton of them especially near the end of the game. Also on hard difficulty, which is what I played the whole game on, some boss enemies get insanely bullet spongey as you wail on them for what seems like forever without much risk of dying. I also have a minor complaint in that the all out attacks seemed pointless at times as you would break the enemies guard only to deal an insanely small amount of damage after using what is supposed to be a finisher. I understand that it shouldn't just instant kill bosses, but sometimes I would use it and the boss health bar wouldn't even visibly move. In terms of positives there are countless including the near perfect transition from turn based to action combat as well as the excellent aesthetics and a story that tugged on my heart strings a couple of times.",

        "content": "A well-polished game that is, unlike other goofy dancing/fighting spin-offs of Persona, great enough to be considered a main-line Persona game. It's enjoyable to see the Phantom Thieves together again, joyfully hanging out one moment and deep in action dungeon-crawling the next. The gameplay is a drastic shift from turn-based Persona 5, but Koei Tecmo managed to revise their mindless hack-and-slash recipe from the Musou franchise to incorporate personas, the element and skill system into the action very well. It feels like I'm playing a normal Persona game, only with the real time action gameplay instead. Very recommended for anyone who enjoys the Persona franchise or the Phantom Thieves gang in particular.",

        "content": "TL:DR\nGameplay? Very Good\nSoundtrack? It's a banger \ud83e\udd18\nArtstyle / Graphics? Beautiful\nStory? Good\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA sequel to Persona 5 - The gameplay changes from the usual turn based combat that you can find in all Persona games to a hack-and-slash type combat you can find in games such as in the Dynasty Warrior series. While it does change the gameplay, the gameplay is very good, especially in Persona 5's artstyle. Gameplay is very good.\n\nSoundtrack can be described with one word: Amazing. The songs you'll usually hear in this game are remixes of songs you'll find in the original Persona 5, but do not get me wrong, THEY ARE NOT BAD! The remixes are just as good as the original songs they are remixed from. You'll enjoy the battle themes, boss themes, etc. The original songs made for this game though are good, while continuing to retain the Persona 5 OST's original style.\n\nThe artstyle is still the same as it was from Persona 5, and it looks gorgeous. As I said from earlier, the combat looks SO fantastic due to Persona 5's artstyle, making everything look flashy and just all around beautiful. Though, I can say it may be overwhelming for a small amount of people, but it wasn't for me.\n\nThe story isn't necessarily the best or what you expect from a Persona game, but it is a good sequel to Persona 5 story-wise. The story does take place a few months after the end of the original Persona 5, and it ends with a satisfying conclusion. For those who hasn't played Persona 5 originally, I wouldn't really recommend playing this game at first, as there may be things you don't understand, or things you would appreciate more if you played through the original Persona 5, such as the characters. That's to say though, the developers for this game did say you can enjoy the game even if you didn't play the original Persona 5, so knock yourself out. Overall though, story's great.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I enjoyed meeting all the characters again and seeing where they left off. That's about it. All this game does for me is make me want to play the original game. I really wanted to like this game, but i couldn't bring myself to really truly enjoy it. Which is a shame cause I really love this franchise. If you do decide to give it a go, do yourself a favor and use controller. The keyboard controls are horrendous, genuinely a thing of nightmares. Overall: 4/10 \n\nNot really my cup of tea ;n;",

        "content": "Probably one of the most fun Persona experiences thus far. I got into the Persona series very late as I only started when Persona 5 first came out. I love this series, the game play feels fun and refreshing compared to some other turn based RPGs I have played in the past, the social links help you build a really big emotional attachment to the characters in the game, and even the story in amazing. Now about Strikers, it takes all of that and simplifies some aspects but makes others lots of fun. Strikers still has an amazing and compelling story just like Persona 5 and 4... is it predictable, a little bit, BUT I think that is okay as the story is really just there to have a base for the AMAZING game play that Strikers has. If you always wanted to try a Persona game but could never get into because you thought there was too much out of combat time the boy do I recommend this game.",

        "content": "I have about 10 friends who have this on their wishlist, which reminds me that I should say, this is NOT Persona 5. This is sequel to the original, faithful in every way EXCEPT that it has a completely different mode of gameplay. It resembles Musou's, if you've played Dynasty Warriors OR Hyrule Warriors, you should know pretty quickly what you're getting into. I'm not a Fighting game man but you're gonna have to remember some button inputs.\n\nShould edit this as I go on. Initial impressions are good, except what in the hell are these keyboard bindings. The main character and Makoto are the only ones without free aiming, just why!?! If you're gonna play this with keyboard and mouse, I think an extra button or two on your mouse will help you out. if you have good reflexes, get the Level 1 Avenger skill (Not available initially), with which you can nullify an attack if you Phanton Dash towards that enemy at the perfect time; I tell you this as it brought me the most joy out of the combat in the game.\n\nI suffer slowdowns after a few battles, and had to reset the game. Later I found out it's caused by the Rendering Scale option. You also have to tab out of the game and come back for the slowdowns to go off or for the Rendering Scale option to apply. I change back to 1.3 Scale if I know there won't be battles for a while so it doesn't look so jagged (You cannot change this option in the middle of battle so don't plan to do it in the middle of the dungeon's boss fight before an hour of unpausable story!)\n\nAtlus, if you're not going to port the original Persona 5 OR Royal (The extended version) just yet, at the very least make your other releases up to par (Tip: Don't look up anything about the game if you wanna avoid spoilers, seriously, Youtube reviews should suffice, avoid comments or even Community Hub content).\n\nYou might want this mod, the letterbox border is just terrible, it looks like a bug: https://gamebanana.com/mods/288445",

        "content": "I've got this game imported from Japan after a month it came out in Japan. So around March of 2020, both on Nintendo Switch and Playstation 4. Beat them both which was nice, if you are expecting similar gameplay to Persona 5 or Royal then you are mistaken, this game has similar gameplay as Hyrule Warriors(That's the first game that popped in my head) As a spinoff (I know some people consider this game as a sequel but I don't really) Scramble, I won't be mentioning it as \"Strikers\", I'll be mentioning it as Scramble since it was called that in Japan. If you think you gonna see characters from Royal in this game, I'm sorry to say but they aren't in it. The story in this game is somewhat alright, I do like in some aspects and some I don't but I won't mention anything due to spoilers and I don't want to spoil anything. The gameplay is pretty alright kinda just stiffy imo, but once you get used to it, you can play it. One thing I would like to complain about is the fusion system, it's feels off like extremely but I think it's just me. Overall I give this game a 7.5/10, it's good for a spinoff but compare to the other Persona spinoffs. It isn't that good in some degree, the only thing I do like is the animation and the story.",

        "content": "persona 5 royal is my favorite game of all time. i even cried when i beat it, absolutely incredible. this abomination of a game is a waste of money and if i had to force myself to beat it: following reasons\n\nthe gameplay is incredibly unfun, the \"jails\" (which is a glorified name for palaces in p5) are unbelievably repetitive, have no flavor, and are reskins of the current city you are in (which is not impressive looking either). the fun part of palaces other than the scenery was that you could do puzzles and explore around. in this game, neither of those exist as everything is a copy and paste of each other and there is 0 fun interaction whatsoever.\n\nthe combat is super SUPER horrible. i really enjoy hard games. i loved dark souls 3 and i have beaten every kingdom hearts game on lvl 1 critical. challenge is NOT an issue. unfortunately, this games combat is lackluster at best but the issue is that there is a fight LITERALLY (i promise i am not exaggerating) every 5 seconds (sometimes less) of walking in this game. if you don't fight youll get behind on levels,  so it's all around bad. not only this, the \"difficulty\" is not actual difficulty, it's just numbers being changed, the attacks aren't any harder to dodge or have any different logic like a harder mode would in another game, it's literally just more health and you deal less damage. this was so horrible and unfun that once i got to the third dungeon i modified the game to one shot every enemy and ignore all damage just so i could get through the game without ripping my hair out from boredom\n\nif you've played and enjoyed a persona game, you KNOW the stories are absolutely amazing. if you would like to avoid spoilers for persona 3 fes, golden, or royal, or this game itself, skip to the next paragraph. persona 5 royal has one of the best stories i've ever seen, be it a book, a video game, or a movie. the characters were great. in this game you have a copy and paste of shido and a character that has a background like akechi's and has the personality of sojiro, all of the antagonists in the game are just rehashed and watered down versions from the previous game. remember kamoshida? the first palace in this game is a girl that takes advantage of men, the second dungeon is a guy who sells writing that isn't actually his... the third dungeon is a cross of okumura and a crappy shido, the fourth is the only actual interesting dungeon that i won't spoil anything for, the fifth has nothing to mention, but the sixth dungeon's antagonist is just a copy and paste of shido and the next one after that is basically mementos and ending the world all over again. nothing in this game is original whatsoever. one of the characters, sophia, is a copy and paste of aigis from persona 3. the only character in this game that i actually liked was the final antagonist, ichinose kuon, had a good personality and ok motive, which is the only reason i liked her, but it was literally just akechi 2.0 and you also could easily tell she would be the antagonist immediately after speaking to her from the first time. the way she was revealed as the antagonist isn't good either. in royal or golden for example you are interacting with the antagonist the whole time and tension is built and you later realize they've been betraying you the whole time, in this game, it's just \"oh, remember kuon from way back when? yeah shes behind this\" it's so unbelievably stupid. also, the final enemy of the game is, \"phones took over everyones lives and we can't think for ourselves now\" literally the dumbest story ever\n\nthe design/look of the game is the only thing i can credit the game on, outside of the dungeons, the game looks absolutely great, despite being terrible in the dungeons. not much to say here\n\nthe music was another strong point. in the persona games. the persona games are the only games i know where the music in them can be good enough to put in playlists with \"real music\", in this game, all of the original songs made specifically for this game are absolute bangers. the only complaint is that any song that received a \"remix\" for scramble that was taken from 5 absolutely sucks in this, because they tried to turn a jazzy thing into rock, and it absolutely sucks.\n\nthe only reason i forced myself to play through this is because i've beaten every persona game and i had to force myself to play this to say i'm fully up with the story in every game and i also spent 70 dollars on it sooooooo\n\nyea don't buy this game",

        "content": "This is an easy recommendation for me. The story can sometimes drag and feel like it's progressing nowhere. At times, the gameplay can feel a little clunky and disjointed. However, ultimately I think these more minor issues can be overlooked in the grand scheme of the game. It was nice to see these characters brought back for another (much shorter) story. \nGetting past these moments where the story can drag is relatively easy, but the gameplay is harder to write off. In my eyes, the original Persona 5 practically perfected JRPG combat, but the Action RPG gameplay on display here is just serviceable. I eventually got used to pausing the action to use persona abilities, but I feel like getting used to this overall hindered my experience with the game. I didn't really have a problem with it, but it's worth noting that this game lacks a confidant system entirely, and the days progress as the story progresses.\nWhile maybe not being quite as good as the original game\u2019s, the soundtrack is very well done. All of the new tracks were really memorable, and remixes of old tracks were too. The opening was great as well.\nThe story starts strong, drags on for a little while, then picks right back up as it climaxes. I think the payoff and experience are well worth putting up with these moments where the story drags. This road trip structure was really enjoyable and held the game together when the story was lacking. If you enjoyed these characters in Persona 5 and thought it\u2019d be fun to go on a road trip with them, then look no further.\n",

        "content": "Recommend getting if you like Persona. P5S is pretty good, a little lacking in story and villain development with sometimes clunky controls.\n\nThis game is basically Atlus's experiment at doing an ARPG, it turned out 'okay'. Camera and lock targeting is pretty lack luster. You have to 'pause' a lot with persona/gun to just get an understanding of what is going on and switching between characters is a little clunky for an modern ARPG. On top of that, the battles are 'instanced' so you lose a little of the open-world-esque that you would expect from an ARPG.\n\nThough you have a calendar like past Personas, the game is a little more free form with the player choices. I actually found the lack of the 'confidant' aspect of character development made it feel pretty empty. Especially since the characters became pretty well developed in P5/P5R and almost none occurred in P5S.",

        "content": "This recommendation comes with some degree of caveat. For those of you looking for a Dynasty Warriors type of game, be prepared for system mechanics that are very unusual to the genre and not super intuitive unless you've played the main branch of Persona games already. For those looking for something similar to the main branch of Persona games, you'll only find bits and pieces of that here, as the gameplay is based around high-speed action rather than turn-based strategy, and things such as Social Links/Confidants and an approach to a day-to-day calender system are not present here. There is still a calender system in this game, but it's much less pronounced since you aren't limited in how much you can do in a single day, and thus there's never really a threat of running out of time.\n\nIf these are things you can work around or if you simply have exposure to both the genre and the Persona series, you'll find a very fun game that manages to combine the systems from both games pretty well. Overall score would be an 8/10 if I had to give it a numerical value.",

It's half as long, the story is half as ambitious, and the gameplay systems are half as detailed compared to persona 5. This game is far more focused on combat and action in general compared to persona 5. There is no confidant system in p5s for example. Overall, I'll give it a 7.5/10. Only recommended to P5 fans.

        "content": "The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\n\nStrategy\n\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\n\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\n\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\n\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\n\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\n\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\n\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\n\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\n\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\n\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\n\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\n\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\n\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\n\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\n\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\n\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider\u2019s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\n\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\n\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\n\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\n\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\n\nA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.",

        "content": "It's very weird to see an entire full-length sequel to Persona 5 with Dynasty Warriors-style action combat, but it's a really cool idea and it's surprisingly well-done! While this game's menu animations aren't quite as immaculate as the original game's, they did a fantastic job carrying over the look of Persona 5 into this engine, to the point where a lot of the time it literally just looks like more of P5, but now running in 60fps. Per Persona tradition, the OST is still absolutely amazing, even in what is essentially a spin-off, and with that classic Warriors-style buttrock flavor appropriately mixed in as well.\n\nThe combat is very interesting at first. While attack combos and switching between characters feels a lot like other recent Warriors games, it still has a LOT of mechanics from P5. Sneaking up on enemies, going in and out of battle encounters, Persona skills, elemental weaknesses, all-out attacks, managing your HP and SP with items, even a lite Confidant system is here. However, much like Warriors games, you are often fighting a LOT of enemies at once, and nothing seems to stop all of them from attacking you at once, with all sorts of different abilities. This makes the combat VERY overwhelming for me, to the point where I definitely prefer Persona games' usual turn-based combat.\n\nAs someone who wasn't particularly impressed by the story and characters in Persona 5, it's kind of hard to get into this game for those same aspects, especially since a lot of it feels like a retread of the original game's plot points anyway. I almost dropped this game entirely since the story is pretty samey in the first few dungeons. Still, if you really like the cast of Persona 5, then you might have a great time with this game.",

I know that the higher ups are (like a lot of Japanese companies) full of fossils who are afraid of PC for some reason, but it is money that the fans would be happy of giving you Atlus.",

I won't speak anything of the story as a. my playtime is low b. youd probably be looking at this from an outsider perspective.\n\nIs P5S worth it? First off, yes. Musou games get really fun once you get the hang of it and all the characters all have unique traits(except Morgana getting a fucking weak 1 damage battering ram move. Not cool Atlus.) and once it gets on a roll, the gameplay gets addicting. First off, the first jail is seriously a chore to get through and it may make it seem like there is nothing else to do. But they made the decision to bar all the side studff until you can get to your next jail.\n\nSecond off, I said it's worth it But only on a sale please. It may have a good gameplay loop but I find this to be a bit... lacking for its current normal price\n\nThird off, you may need to atleast have knowledge of PS's plot to get the story\n\nNext, the music is amazing and absolutely gets you in the mood to straight destroy\n\nThe game also has a semi open world aspect where you get to buy stuff so you can cook or get it ready for use. Also be sure to always talk to your teammates in the non-metaverse map if its a new day. They will usually harbor some loot for you.\n\nUmm... damn writing a long review is hard.",

        "content": "Have you played Persona 5 / Persona 5 Royal? If you said No. Do not buy this game as it is required story wise. \n\nAfter just completing Persona 5 Royal after 140 hours and absolutely loving it for the masterpiece that it is. a True 10/10. I was looking for more and i came upon P5S. Is this game better then Persona 5 Royal? No, Not by a long shot. Is this game worth playing? Yes. The combat does take alot of time to get used to and can be at times annoying. Especially the first half of the game. The bosses tend to be HP sponges and do not be scared to lower the diff. Normal is mostly good. Do not play this game on hard unless you want to suffer. The best part of this game is spending more time with all the characters that you grew to love in Persona 5 and meeting some new ones on the way. The story is solid and there will be some rehashing, related to Royal sem 3. (sem 3 is not cannon in this game). It was nice to travel around Japan and see the different areas as well. Overall i would rate the game a 7.5/10.",

        "content": "P5S, maybe surprisingly, feels like a full and proper sequel to P5 (but, of course, not Royal..). Clocking in at about a 45 hour playthrough for me, it's a bit a good amount more lean than P5 (which took me about 110 hours), and I'm all for it. The social sim half of P5 is now condensed to a lot of screen time with your teammates (as well as building a general Bond meter to get skill points), but the fact that you and the group are ALWAYS together means you don't feel like you're being shorted on social content. The musou-style combat (combined with traditionally Persona-style dungeon exploring) works excellently and, frankly, I liked it way more than the turn-based combat of P5(R). I highly recommend it if you liked P5 and want more time hanging out with the gang.",

Same basic battle system, but here you're able to keep hitting attack in-between all your persona abilities to hit the weak spots and move around a bit. You'll still mainly be relying on hitting weaknesses and then performing all-out attacks. \n\nStory-wise, nothing groundbreaking here. It's just a road-trip romp with all the friends you made in P5 plus a new addition or two. \n\nOverall, if you wanted more adventures from the original P5, then this game is for you!",

It's repetitive/shallow enough that I'll never replay it unlike the main games and the first dungeon is a slog since you don't get the abilities that keep the pace up/add a smidge of combat depth until later but it picks up after that. In other words, worth a playthrough if you're a fan and can stomach some of the early stodginess.",

When you do an All-out attack or the screen says \"Shows over\" it's supposed to signify telling the enemy \"smell ya later\" in a flashy end to the fight. But here it takes maybe a centimeter off some midboss' interminable health bar? The best thing this game's combat does is make you appreciate how well designed the original P5's combat is. Not many people look or feel good frantically button-mashing into a huge dude. It's just awful; it's awkward, it's long, it's painful, it tests reflexes that you didn't need in P5, and you have to do way more of it than you did before because this is a much more fighty game.\n\nCan't speak for later antagonists, but at least the first one is a complete writeoff. One of the things Persona games do brilliantly is encode a larger theme into the motivation for each foe. P5 is centered around rebellion, so that every boss feels almost cathartic to beat. P5S has, at least so far, just been \"let's beat this person up because they're bad and we're good\". There's no theme to this, and it makes the story feel way less fulfilling. The only thing I'm still here for is more of the main cast, and even then there are no bonding events so the interaction is superficial at best.",

        "content": "I'm not exactly the most professional person to give my opinion obviously, and especially not someone who's played a ton of Persona outside 5 and it's spin-offs. But I'd say that this was an extremely fun experience. The story isn't all that complex or thought provoking and can be a tad generic, or even rehashed from the original at times. But every area has a good message and consistently interesting dialogue between the party members. Like the original, the cast is great. And the two new additions to the crew are very much welcome. Then combat, much like the story, is pretty simple. Many of the mechanics are the same as far as weaknesses, and how buffs affect you and the enemy go. However this time it's put in an entirely different system. Ditching the turn based combat of the Persona series and making it a stylized and unique version of the Dynasty Warriors format. And with that in mind I can concede that it isn't for everyone. But in my personal opinion, the combat is fun, fast paced, and certain battles can genuinely feel grand. Notably the various boss fights. All the animations are very good and stay true to the style. Each character has their own personal tech and that gives them even more diversity than just simply different elements and basic attacks. All the showtime attacks look great as expected, and all out attacks are just as satisfying. I don't even NEED to get started on the music. Every track is just so amazing, and best of all you never have to hear the same track over and over since every battle is randomized. All the remixes are fantastic, and a personal favourite of mine is counterstrike. But on that note, I'll complete this miniature review. I'm yet to play New Game Plus, as I am writing this almost immediately after completing the main story. But I can only assume it'll add some bonus content that add a little more spice into a second playthrough. Thank you for reading, and I hope if you buy this game you enjoy it as much as I.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the summer vacation I never had. It functions as both a spin-off of a spin-off and a direct sequel to Persona 5. Therefore, I would highly recommend playing Persona 5 before diving into Strikers. Also, be sure to bring your PS4 controller for this one, as I felt the frantic combat feels significantly better on a controller.\n\nSpeaking of combat, it amazes me how well the flair and strategy of Persona combat mixes with the frantic, visually-busy Musou combat. The only other Musou game I've played is Hyrule warriors, yet I enjoyed the combat in this game much more. In fact,  it feels more like the combat in FFVII Remake. Button-mashing won't get you far; I had to turn down the difficulty to Easy until I was acclimated with the combat mechanics. Each character and Persona has their own combos, elemental affinities, and spells. Nothing makes me feel more like a badass than mowing down an army of Shadows with the power of friendship and the manifestations of your inner rebel. \n\nMoving on to the story, it parallels much of the narrative drawn in the original Persona 5. Without going into details, I will say that the first couple Jails serve to introduce you to the mechanics and lore of Jails. The monarchs of said jails are just one-and-done antagonists whose hearts you change. After this, the way the story ramps up parallels Persona 5 rather closely. It should be noted that the story is shorter (with regards to Persona standards). However, this is not an issue and I felt the pacing was actually well-done.\n\nMusic in the Persona series is nothing short of exceptional, and Strikers is no different. I did not think it was possible that \"Rivers in the Desert\" or \"Blooming Villain\" could be made any more epic than they already are. Later, you can even customize which songs play during battle.\n\nThe voice acting is stellar, including those of the new characters. Sophia is such sweetheart; her character growth is well written. As for Zenkichi, his character arc draws parallels to Dojima from P4. He and Sophia fit right into the Persona universe, unlike Lana in Hyrule Warriors, who seemed out-of-place.\n\nWith the amount of action going on, the game never dipped in framerate or crashed. One of my favorite changes involves NG+. You get all the characters and equipment from your first playthrough, unlike in P5 where you were limited to certain characters because of the story. It allows for ample time to customize and deck out all the Phantom Thieves with the best gear and moves. \n\nOverall, there is not much I disliked about the game. The damage sponginess of some of the bosses on the harder difficulties is a bit exasperating (and don't get me started on Merciless...). Nevertheless,  this is definitely worth a purchase if you liked Persona 5.",

The game takes the world of Persona 5 and mixes it with Dynasty Warriors to create a repetitive game with an unimpressive story. The best thing about this game existing is that it brings the community ever so slightly closer to a port of Persona 5 coming to PC.",

        "content": "The Gameplay (although kinda gets repetitive just pressing the same two buttons), soundtrack and characters are amazing and it's a huge improvement over the original Persona 5, but here's a couple of things that bother me as I'm still playing the game while I am writing/editing this (long??) review and i hope these could be taken notes for in the future to improve upon:\n\n1. (Issue that connects to the Modern Games)\nThe other battle songs being locked behind a DLC paywall (even though i paid for it so that the main songs wouldn't start getting on my nerves) which was the same issue i had with P5 when i played it years ago because of that.\n\n2. The Calendar doesn't do anything since there's no deadline making returning and that leads to the unecessary issue of  leaving and entering the Jails repetitive for some healing instead of giving the checkpoints some sort of healing station in the dungeons like in the older games since the calendar barely does anything like in 3-5.\n\n3. (Another big Issue that also connects to the Modern games)\nIt's been so many games and spin offs after P2: Eternal Punishment and there still isn't an option to make the Navi shut up, like Rise and Futaba because they're very annoying because their lines get repeated a lot and gets tiring especially Futaba with her very \"quirky and cool\" gaming references with her \"\"\"\"\"crippling social anxiety\"\"\"\" problem when the first Navi did her character better because she's quiet and chill (and that was over 13 years ago with Persona 3 in 2008 on the mf PS2) so i have to mute the Voices entirely during bosses and Normal Combat making the cutscenes afterwards awkward til i finally get to actually open up the menu after 10 million cutscenes bringing my next issue being..\n\n4. That i wish i wasn't bloated with cutscenes that last longer than the gameplay which completely ruins the pace during the jails when the game comes to a stop for just a cutscene of everyone standing still til i can move again, why not have them talk about it in the top right box while i move around, which is an ongoing issue that just gets tiring after the first jail but thankfully there's an option for me to skip cutscenes so I'm glad they put that lol.\n\n4.5. The Second Hot Spring Scene is self-explanatory, just not really all that funny after Persona 3 since that had a fun minigame with it.\n\n5. Why can i not move my camera as i am moving inside of a vent like in P5?\n\n6. Why can i not see my Showtime gauge/bar like how HP, SP and Ammo are shown in the UI instead of hoping to god i get a showtime to do DMG/Knock Down Midbosses that are objectivelly harder than the main bosses\n\n6.5 But it's Okay because nobody bothered to playtest Yusuke because he demolishes literally everything with his two hit combo no matter how strong the boss is to Physical\n\n7. Istg i feel like the AI in this game is how people see the AI in Persona 3 but instead this is worse than that because you don't have a tactics menu to have some control of your party so that you tell what each Party Members does to prioritize for you instead of them going headfirst dive into a modboss/boss and die out of nowhere, or even use their SP for no reason when i don't want them to which connects to my previous second issue, the main healers/support not healing Futaba when i want those character specifically to focus on support.\nIt's a real shame because i'm minding my own business in combat to then just suddenly realize two of my characters died while all of them were together and i'm out of items to revive them back and lose the fight countless times because of it.\n\n8. I don't know if it's because of the hardware I use since i own a Low End Laptop (little bit higher than the minimum requirements) o play games and play it on the lowest settings for it to run good ..but like, to my experience the game tends to softlock in the loading screen a couple of times especially when i go back in the Van so i have to press Alt + F4 to exit the game possibly losing a lot of progress that i haven't saved which is enfuriating since all the progress i made didn't matter because of this\n\nHere's the Positive that i have to say about it for my own experience:\n\nOverall my favourite parts about this game are the Combat (surprisingly after all i said), the two new characters: Sophia and Zenkichi, the Villains are sorta well better written with them having backstories instead of just being evil because they're a \"nasty\" adult and the god dang soundtrack, especially the ones in each area since to me they're overall the strongest part of this game making me not quitting or refunding it entirely, still pretty cool game i recommend a lot, not at full price because this doesn't deserve the $60 tag so get it during a sale\n\n7/10",

        "content": "TL,DR: It's not quite as good as the original game, but it's a spin-off, so what do you expect? The style is much more hack-and-slash and doesn't allow for nearly as much sneakery, but I still like it. I think it's easier than the og game, so if you want a challenge, you'll probably need to turn up the difficulty later on. The story is good, but could have benefited from a little more work. The game keeps crashing for me, and it got more frequent after I updated my computer, but I'm only passable with computers, so I don't know what to attribute that to. It could just be my computer, honestly.\n\nOkay, so I really love the game, because I missed Persona 5 and wanted to play it again but I don't own it (I stayed with my cousin and played it while I was there) but recently, it's been crashing about every hour or so so I updated my computer to see if that would help, and it just made the crashes more frequent. Unfortunately, I'm no computer geek, so I have no idea what's going on or why and no way to figure it out because I'm scared of messing stuff up even more and also because I wouldn't know what I'm looking at. I can't tell if this is an issue with my computer, which is a zephyr gaming computer, I think, so it's fairly beefy compared to my old dell, or if it's an issue with the game. The game itself is very good if you're just looking for more Persona 5 content, but this game isn't in the same, turn-based style of gameplay, so be warned. It's a more of a battle royale with fewer options for sneaking around in the shadows. Personally, I've found it much easier than the original game and have turned it up to the hard difficulty, but I enjoy it nevertheless. I haven't finished the game yet, but I've found the story to be quite interesting. Not nearly as complex and planned out as the original game, mind you, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. I've been playing the game infrequently, so pardon my lapses in memory. The cooking mechanic is interesting, but they don't offer too many sp items for just one party member. There are several for full party, but the coffee beans needed to make Leblanc's coffee are offered very infrequently. I also feel like the areas you stay at get a little boring after a while, because it does take a good amount of time to beat a Jail (which is the Palace substitute. Jails are more for people with trauma who didn't deal with it in healthy ways and didn't get help, I think). Overall, I think it's a pretty good game with an interesting addition to the view of the Persona 5 Metaverse. It could use some work, but perfection isn't real or a healthy expectation to have. It's best enjoyed if you're just looking for something new to play once you've finished with Persona 5 and want a new story in the same universe. It does keep crashing, but I don't know if that's my computer or the game so I can't really comment on that.",

        "content": "First off, you will have to have beaten Persona 5 do its ending to understand this game. And that is not a game for the faint of heart, it requires a significant time investment. But damn, is it worth it. And this game stands on its own as a fantastic sequel and spinoff. It is the first truly great Dynasty-Warriors type spinoff I've ever played. All the others have ranged from bad-mediocre. But this game stands on the shoulders of Persona 5 and has a fantastic combat system, story, music, and characters. Only complaints are that the plot takes a little while to get on its feet, some predictability in the plot, the lack of exp for members not in your party leaving them underleveled whenever you want to change your party setup, and the relative simplicity of the individual characters' movesets when compared to other games of this type. Otherwise, a fantastic game. Totally reccomend.",

The dads in these games are always the best characters, no cap. 9/10, Even though it's a Persona game and frankly this should be par for the course, it was surprisingly lengthy.\n\nedit 1: the game sometimes dropped frames near the end but it was nothing awful.\n\nedit 2: i wish i got the deluxe instead of standard as i would've loved to see the behind the scenes work put into this game, as well as have the phenomenal soundtrack which made at least made me have a lot of frission.",

I hate nothing more than a series that doesn't know when to just move onto its next iteration in the franchise and instead milk a specific portion of it.\n\nEnter Persona 5 Strikers. Bought on sale with an eye roll and wanting to kill some time before the release of Monster Hunter: Rise. I can safely say they did not skimp on the game by any means. More story for the characters you've gotten to know through Persona 5 (excluding Royale), and a great action-oriented game that manages to hold all sorts of wonderful story beats in the future for you.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you liked Persona 5 - give this a shot at least. It's good.",

The color design and overall aesthetic is exciting and engaging. The story, comic book-like dialogue and animated cut scenes all offer a solid story and presentation. \n\nThe combat difficulty is very fair w/o being brain dead easy and manages to stay just \"fresh\" enough. The ability to play as different party members, use various Peronas, Showtime attacks and so forth keeps the gameplay engaging. \n\nThe stealth mechanic + all out attack has gotten a little old at just 10 hours in. The story, overall game aesthetic and other combat mechanics help carry the game through this weakness.\n\nIf you have not played Persona 5 check out the P5 Plot synopsis on Wikipedia. This will allow you to better understand why the Phantom Thieves don't like the cops, what a Palace is, etc. With that background you will better appreciate the plot and story of P5S.\n\nOverall I give this game an 8/10.",

But the way japanese games keep spewing the same repetitive text for several scenes, it gets kind of ridiculous. \nThe combats fun, but the writing is far weaker than P5 itself. So get it if you dont care about the story. But if you care about the story, expect way more writing where they repeat information several times.",

The battle system takes a bit of getting used to, and is much more frantic than the methodical turn-based system of P5, so it's worth reading a bit about that (avoiding spoilers) to make sure it won't get frustrating.",

THE LAST THING I WILL SAY IS THAT YOU.NEED.TO.PLAY.WITH.A.CONTROLLER. Otherwise you will be messing with your key binds and it makes it feel very weird to play.

My only complaints with the gameplay were that it played more like a Platinum or Action RPG like the Tales of games instead of a Dynasty Warriors style of game. You're not quite chewing through hordes of grunt enemies effortlessly, but you're also not just focusing combos into a single enemy. It's a hybrid of the two that took a little adjusting to figure out, but the story was quite a trip (pun intended).",

        "content": "An excellent balance between classic Persona gameplay, and hack-and-slash madness.\n\nI'll won't deny in saying that I never actually played the original Persona 5/Royal, having only watched my friend stream the game. But I can still say with certainty that the flair, writing, and characters feel straight out of the main game. While this may be labeled as a \"Spinoff\", it is just as much a true sequel to the original Persona 5. (Not Royal.)\n\nDespite being seen as a \"Warriors\" spinoff of sorts like other series received (Such as Hyrule Warriors or Fire Emblem Warriors), Strikers keeps many of the aspects that make the Warriors games have their flair and charm, while also keeping many story and gameplay aspects that make it feel like a true Persona game as well. The use of skills, weakness exploitation, and even Joker's Wild Card ability are all present, and translated faithfully in the newer hack-and-slash gameplay style. While at the same time still feeling like a dedicated RPG. I'm honestly impressed how well they kept the feel of Persona in the gameplay, not making it feel too alienated as a sequel to P5. (Unlike with my experience with games like Hyrule Warriors, which feels like a Warriors game, but with Zelda characters slapped onto it.) Even so; the gameplay is still very different from regular Persona. It just is faithful in carrying over a lot of signature aspects of the series.\n\nAnd as for the story; I really enjoyed it as well. I won't go into many details, but I can still say for certain that it feels like a natural progression from the ending of Persona 5.\nThe characters all feel the same, they all keep their original voices, and some characters who may have been lacking in P5 got more development and purpose in Strikers. (Primarily with Haru.)\nEven though there are no longer any social aspects in Strikers, the writing and character interactions still feel like what you'd see in regular Persona, albeit a bit more linear. Which honestly; I don't have a problem with.\nI also really enjoyed the new characters added to the game, especially Zenkichi.\n\nAll-in-all, P5 Strikers is a fantastic game, especially if you're a fan of P5 already.\nMy only gripe is that due to being a sequel to P5, you kinda need to see the story of the base game's True Ending to understand a lot of points covered in the story of Strikers. But at the same time; if your there just for the gameplay and not so much the story (Or you just don't mind spoilers), then the game itself has its own content and story to look forward to. Even if you may not pick up on all the references made to the previous game.\n\nEven still; I highly recommend this game. Truly a real treat for me to play this year",

Once you prepare all stats 99 and a few regen items, new game + merciless feels rewarding and punishing at the right moment. It felt like playing Persona 5. You no longer think that maybe you're under leveled or the fight feels it takes too long. It feels just right and dodges feels great. *Also auto dodges are the shit. Makes everything easy.

        "content": "Great stuff, but you should really play (and like) Persona 5 first. Everything except combat is more of the same in a very good way, fresh and new but familiar. \n\nCombat is a whole different beast, and while I thought it was pretty shaky at first, I grew to very much enjoy it a couple of levels in. It's reminiscent of a Dynasty Warriors style brawler, but most fights with masses of enemies are very short. Bosses are considerably more durable, and will mash you if you only swing mindlessly. Personally I blew through the early fights until I hit the first real boss, died enough times in a row that the game recommended I switch to easy difficulty (not happening), and went back to the tutorials to really learn all the mechanics. Started having a blast shortly after that.\n\nCharacters are charming and engaging, but it does have the hallmark cringe perv scenes endemic to anime (not egregious, but in poor taste).",

WTF ATLAS? IT IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME YOU ASSHOLES! you can tell by the graphs that 99% of the reviews were made the day the game was released which means 99% didnt even play the game before making reviews. steam reviews is like a mafia. you only have a voice if you pay in and mob mentality rules. fuck you steam, FUCK YOU ATLAS AND FUCK YOU DENUVO!",

        "content": "Atlus knows how to milk a franchise really well. Instead of creating dairy products that becomes expired even before they are shipped, they ensure that all of their cows are in good health alongside carrying out daily inspections and QC procedures on their machines before doing anything. Almost every single one of their spin offs are made with love and care. \n\nThat includes Persona 5 Strikers. The turn-based + musou hybrid is what I would like to see in future musou games. Although the combos provided for each character are less varied, it does not overstay its welcome as they are also numerous persona skills that we can use to defeat a horde of enemies. On top of that, by utilizing the baton pass from P5, we can control 4 different characters in a single map. Something that most musou titles lack. In addition, the game includes two new playable characters. An AI girl named Sophia and another one which I am not going to mention the name to avoid spoiler territory. Trust me, they fit so well in the phantom thieves gang and each of them will receive their own spotlights they deserve. \n\nAN IMPORTANT NOTE: \n\nDo not play this game, if you have not yet play the mainline game or at least watch a walkthrough on youtube. Bits of the plot from P5 will be mentioned a few times so proceed with caution. \n\nIf you love persona 5, then you will surely going to like strikers as well, Don't let the musou tag turn you off, the combat feels natural and not overly repetitive like the traditional musou games. Of course, it depends on peoples' preferences at the end of the day. As expected from Atlus, their remarkable assortment of musical pieces are unique, memorable and well-composed as always. For those who want a fairly lengthy JRPG, then persona 5 strikers is perfect for you too judging by the total amount of hours I spent to complete all 50 side quests which will appear as an achievement if you manage to unlock it + beating the main story. \n\n*CUTE AI GIRL GO BRRR*\n",

        "content": "This is definitely for fans of Persona 5. The Musou style combat takes a lot of getting used to, weather or not you're accustomed to Dynasty Warriors or not, it's pretty different, and I had to change the difficulty to Easy until I got the hang of things and then reset it to Normal. \n\nIt has some clunkiness, but the story will keep you going if you liked P5. This is a direct sequel, so definitely play this for the story if nothing else.\n\nBeing an action game, you control each Phantom Thief individually, and can freely switch between them. they all fight quite differently and have their own combos/specials, and you'll most likely find one or two that you like and stick with them for most of the game.\n\nYou still obtain Personas and Joker can equip/fuse them etc in the Velvet room. But with so many characters to play as (8 other than Joker) I barely found any use in directly controlling Joker. Why use a fire based Persona when Ann can already use fire spells and use her fire whip moves that cost no SP? And same with each other Phantom Thief with their respective elemental spells. It made sense in a turn-based RPG like the original  P5, but here you can just hack/slash/spell cast to your hearts content.\n\nAll in all a fun, mindless game that honestly needs tweaking in the combat department, but I'd still recommend this to fans of P5 for the story, and to see these beloved characters return in a new setting.",

        "content": "This game really is a sequel to the Vanilla P5, with two great new characters, development for the ones that need it (Specially Psycho-Fluff girl Haru). and a great OST that replicates the style of the original.\n\nAlthough considered a warriors game; it really translates the SMT/Persona mechanics, making the game feel more distinct than just another button masher.\n\nPlaying this on hard is the best experience because you can have the fun of ravaging through hordes of enemies while also keeping check of every stat, weakness and strength so that you don't get your ass handed to you instantly by a strong or even \"weak\" enemies (If you know, you know)\n\nBest of both worlds; Stfu about P5R on PC pls.",

        "content": "It's hard to say this as Persona 5 and Persona 4 are some of my favourite games of all time, but this game has some below average gameplay. Boss fights can drag on and fights with random enemies are either frustrating or too easy. It seems like I spend most of my time spamming shoot rather than pulling off combos and using magic because enemies do too much damage. SP is much better spent using healing spells rather than elemental or buff / debuff spells because damage is so high. You can use other characters, but why would you when Joker is the best one to be using. Maybe it's because is just came off playing the One Piece Pirate Warriors series but the lack of variety during combat drags this game down. Usually your combo is 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,1,1,1,2,2 (1 being a light attack and 2 being a heavy attack), because those combos use your equipped persona's element (which means you don't have to spend precious SP on offensive magic to hit weaknesses). \n\nThe Velvet Room and persona fusion are cut down and almost a waste of time in this game. You cannot just fuse any two personas anymore. There are set combinations you can use. This is sad because this is what originally drew me to the Persona series in the first place. \n\nHowever, combat and the Velvet Room are the only bad things about this game. Just like Persona 5, the UI and design elements to this game are fantastic. Seeing your equipped persona in the bottom left of the screen always looks cool because there is a unique portrait there for every persona. Menu transitions don't get in the way too much and are worth the time they use. \n\nThe main characters are just as I knew them in Persona 5 (with the disappointing lack of Dr. Maruki and Sumi from the Royal version of the game). Yusuke still makes me laugh. Ryuji is still endearingly dumb. Haru gets more screen time (thank god) and Makoto is still best girl. The new characters Sophia and Mr. Bloodborne (forgot his actual name) are lovely and fit in very well with the main group, with Sophia genuinely being my fourth favourite character (behind Yusuke, Makoto and Haru).\n\nTake this review lightly, as I've only beaten the 2nd Palace and I'm working through the 3rd one right now. I just wanted to write down my feelings on this game so far.",

The action gameplay is decent and very stylish. The presentation, variety, and story content is just as good as P5 but with a less serious and slightly more comedic tone.",

The antagonists are really lame and don't really give you a drive to keep playing and along with your party members they feel like an after thought when side quests you do for them don't really make any social link event happen. Combat will also get too repetitive because it just becomes X and Y through the entire game with occasional oh maybe I will actually manually use my Persona's skills. All I can say is get it on sale",

Maybe not cannon(not entirely sure) but is perfected in so many ways similar to persona 5, and there are rarely any moments in the game where you are not feeling happy or accomplished within its difficult tasks. Its a wonderful game. And I would love to see maybe just 1 more game like it as another continuation, but possibly similar to persona 3? Not sure exactly but I would love to give some pointers to the developers and share opinions and ideas! But seriously, love the work and the innovations made inside, especially the 3D battlefield and Impossible mode, with the reaper and more! All the challenges are worth beating and playing because it feels nothing but rewarding and fun with the characters dialogue!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an excellent spin-off of Persona 5 and an overall fantastic Musou game. Based on vanilla P5, it leaves out  the new stories from Royal. It's unfortunate, but the new ideas they bring are really great, one of the new characters is really compelling and an excellent addition to the cast. It's definitely a game I'd recommend to anyone who enjoyed Persona 5. It's a fun continuation with a good story and the Phantom Thieves hanging out and travelling across Japan. This might seem obvious, but if you weren't a fan of P5 then this game won't do much for you. Long stretches of cutscenes and characters the game expects you to be familiar with won't be too appealing if you haven't been sucked into the world of P5. Only other major complaint is the post-game, or lack thereof. It's disappointing, especially for a Musou game that can usually have you spend over 100 hours trying to complete the various missions. \n\nOverall though, like I said, Persona 5 Strikers is an excellent game and one that any fan of Persona 5 should play.",

The characters were all very likable and made you want to spend as much time with them doing meaningless shenanigans with them and wishing you could have had more of them at the end of the game which is what strikers manages manages give you in spades as the game is essentially you and your mates go on a road trip and just get into random shenanigans which is just generally enjoyable.\n\nAlong with that this game's combat system is one that manages to be very fast paced and mobile while still maintaining the style and feel that p5 had, overall being honestly more enjoyable to spend time with as it manages not to get repetitive overtime and maintains the vibrant and fast paced feel that it has when you first experience it which is all enhanced by the soundtrack that fits the the designs of the areas they accompany or make you feel invincible as you go through waves of enemies.\n\nAll and all I had a blast with this game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pick it up.",

Additionally, since the game takes place on the road over a short time period with characters you already know, the time management and social links have been replaced by bond skills, which are much simpler and a bit less satisfying. Despite these huge changes to the formula, [i]Strikers[/i] manages to strongly hold on to it's [i]Persona[/i] identity. [i]Persona 5 Strikers[/i] is both a worthy sequel and a blast in it's own right, and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who enjoyed P5, and probably to any hack'n'slash/jrpg/arpg fans too.

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is like what Age of Calamity was for Breath of the Wild: A must-have experience for fans\n\nThe whole game feels more like a Persona game than a Warriors one, and the mechanics that Persona fans are familiar with, such as fusing, were greatly improved from even Persona 5 Royal. The things that were changed and made to be different to reflect upon its direction, such as the combat, is incredibly fun, rewards skill, and is something I found myself enjoying over the original turn-based formula that the Persona series is known for.\n\nIf you're looking for a less time-consuming Persona experience with a greater development into its combat than with time management around tasks and social links, then this should be up your alley. Despite the feeling of being a Persona-lite title, its gameplay loop is meaty and offers an incentive for fighting battles for stat boosters and a constant means of getting stronger. I'm playing NG+ on the hardest difficulty, and it's still feeling adequately challenging enough to keep me on my toes despite having Personas that would make the previous games into a laughing stock.\n\nIf you're unsure about getting it at full price, then be sure to pick it up when it's on a sale. You won't regret it. The Digital Deluxe Edition is worth it for the little extras especially the legacy BGM tracks.",

Mostly it will just be references to the original story won't make sense but doesn't keep you from following this ones story. It will spoil it though obviously so if you don't want that I would play 5 first. \n\nAlso the game play is completely different from the main line Persona games being made by Koei and if you played one of their games then that is what it plays like, combo beat up with summoning personas.

A chance to see what happens after the events of the main game and an opportunity to go on another mission that expands the wold of the original. The new battle system is top-notch, and resembles the action-oriented battles of Final Fantasy VII Remake. Honestly, I would love if Persona 6 had a more refined version of the battle system in this game. It is so much fun to see the Phantom Thieves move about as they do in the cutscenes of the original game, but this time you're in control. The fusion system has been further simplified in service of removing many hard annoyances, but with the tradeoff of reduced Persona count. I would love to see a sequel to this game with a few small things changed, but as it stands I can heartily recommend this entry.",

        "content": "pros:\n- very catchy music\n- very fun and innovative game play\n- diverse ways of managing fights\n- the jails (dungeons) are very fun to explore. level design is great\n- get to travel to many places that you don't get to in base P5\n- decently challenging secret bosses for you to grind\n\ncons:\n- story is rather weak and fairly predictable compared to the base game or to royal\n- not much character development except for the new characters introduced in P5S\n- AI for your party members can be frustrating. Although AI in this game is already some of the better ones that I've seen, your teammates can still act like buffoons and get killed constantly by easily dodgeable attacks.\n\noverall great game. The highlight of this game for me is gameplay, dungeon exploration and fight management (and music of course). Don't expect a great story and you'll enjoy this game a lot.\n",

        "content": "A very impressive and unique to the incredibly popular Persona 5. Initially seeing that it was being developed by Omega Force kinda put me on guard as I've never been a big fan of the Warriors series of games, but I was still curious. Turns out that this is probably my favorite of their games. Gameplay is a surprising blend of those Warrior games (fight huge swathes of enemies who might throw in a few hits here and there) and Persona's weakness/resistance system. You have your basic combos that develop as you play each of the characters and you can bust out their Persona to do attacks that enemies are susceptible to, to knock 'em down and do an ALL OUT ATTACK that does huge damage to every enemy around. Each character has their own combo strings and variants that they learn as you play as them, so each one feels unique to each other, so try each one and they might fit your play style better than another, aside from worrying about weaknesses.\n\nPresentation is great, aside from some minor jagged edge problems that you can fix if you look up how (I've forgotten how exactly, it's been a while, but it also made everything else a tad funky). The stylization of characters and the world is still spot on to Persona 5 (no surprise), runs mostly well and of course the music is still S-tier at worst. You'll definitely have new favorites after playing through this.\n\nThe story and new characters are also pretty solid! I love both Sophie and Zenkichi, they're colorful additions that don't feel out of place with the core cast at all. They're well fleshed-out on top of the main P5 cast getting some more time that they hadn't before and also allowed for some more interactions among each of them. Only issue is that some of the villains of each new zone you get to explore aren't as fleshed out. One being familiar with a teammate and you don't really get much more than \"I thought you were good before, but now this happened and you're bad.\" to \"Ah, sorry about the sudden bad. We cool now?\" and then you leave. I mean you learn more than that, obviously, but it doesn't hit as strongly as some other characters developments. And those who played any spinoffs or the Royal version: it's focused on Persona 5. Old character portraits are used as opposed to the refreshed ones in Royal, Sumi doesn't exist in this timeline and neither does all the Royal specific changes to the story. Gonna miss Sumi, she was great and hope they push her in likely spinoffs, along with Zenkichi and Sophie but we'll see as unlikely as it is.\n\nAll in all, absolutely loved this game so much so I 100% it. A bit easier to do than core Persona 5, and on par with Persona 5 Royal. If you've played Persona 5 and loved it, absolutely hop onto this game. If you've played Persona 5 Royal and loved that, you'll be a bit saddened or confused, if that's the only version you played. Either way, it's excellent!\n\n(PS, IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING: RYUJI IS A POWERHOUSE, UTILIZE PLAYING AS HIM.)",

This might be the entry persona game for players that dont like turn based rpgs but are curious about the persona subverse. Still as an avid Turn based rpg lover I think the pauses for menus and skill usage makes this game keep the charm of turn based rpgs while using action combat. Id give this game a 8 out of 10 as of now.",

        "content": "Nominated this game for the \"Best Soundtrack\" award which it totally deserves.\nother than that the game is undeniably fun :\n\nThe dungeon/metaverse sections are the heart of the experience, Omega Force and P-Studios translated the original turn based combat into a musou style game pretty well; the fighting mechanics are implemented perfectly, combat feels fast and fluid while it still feels like a persona game. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to the original P5, so unless you played it or watched the anime you wont understand most of the rules here, cause they aren't explained that much.\nthe story it-self is good and the new characters are written pretty well. \nyou can still pick between multiple dialogue options but they all lead to the same result and there aren't different endings like there was in the original game; this can be good or bad based on the person playing it. for me it was fine, cause it wasn't forcing me to lookup responses and pick the one that led to the better ending, I just picked the goofy options that I liked.\n\nthe game is still stylized like the other persona games and will age well for years to come but swapping between different Menu pages (like the inventory ,etc.) has become a bit slower, (they added longer transition animations to them) which you'll get used to it after a while.\n\n[b] Positives : [/b]\n[list]\n[*] Ploughing through a large number of enemies is fun.\n[*] there are a lot of custom hit combos and animations for the different personas you gather.\n[*] there are weak points for the enemies just like the original game and executing them in a hack n slash manner feels satisfying. so you'll have to pick your party based on the enemy types in that dungeon.\n[*] You can also pick between all of the phantom thieves, each one with their own combo set and fighting style (some better than the others) so the combat is pretty deep.\n[*] World traversal (although a bit restricted) is pretty fun too. stealth is still in the game.\n[/list]\n\nSo if you are a fan of Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal or just love hack 'n slash games in general, you'll definitely enjoy playing this one.\n\n[b] Negatives and Nitpicks: [/b]\n[list]\n[*] Social part of the gameplay is a bit butchered compared to the original P5 but its fine for the context of the game. the over-world gameplay is fine too, you have to sometimes gather info from the NPCs and maybe buy a couple of stuff for the dungeons.\n\n[*] The padding in certain areas was pretty blatant, there are side missions (Requests) but most of them are added just for padding the playtime (although the game is pretty long itself). the Requests aren't that different to the main game, they are mostly fetch quests for an specific item or \"kill x number of enemies\" or even \"replay a boss\" a couple of times and etc... but the rewards are worth it. although i must add that for some side quests you'll spend a bit of time with the others members which is always great to see in the story.\n[*] The grind for the BOND points at the end of the game was boring, went through half of the merciless NG+ mode to complete it for 100%.\n[*] It takes a long time to beat [u]some[/u] bosses/elites, you'll just have to spam the weak point for a couple of minutes and apply buffs. without much else to do.\n[*] 2 out of the 8 dungeons feel short and half-assed ([spoiler] Okinawa and Kyoto to be specific [/spoiler]), they make sense story wised but I preferred the longer and larger dungeons.\n[/list]\n\nIf you are a fan of Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal or just love hack 'n slash games in general, you'll definitely enjoy playing this one, cause i did.\n83/100",

The game have some a the greatest soundtrack in a Persona game I have the chances to listen too, they really capture the essence of Persona 5 and brought it forward in this one.\n\nIt's also a Great Musou type game which I honestly don't play a lot of but still manage to have fun while playing so. The combination of easy control, fast-paced gameplay,flashy combos and finisher really make the game enjoyable. Well at least for me a Persona fan.\n\nAll and all this is just a nice Musou type game with P5 aesthetic slap on top of it, I can guaranteed that you will have fun playing this game.",

I'm not nearly done with the game, but I've got enough time here to say that I'm pleased with how well this was made.\n\nI never expected that nearly every aspect of the game would be improved upon. The story is rich and drives in more development for the characters, songs have either been remixed and remastered to fit the action style (and nearly all of the new songs added are complete bops), and the style seen in P5 has been expanded upon and grown to a massive scale.\n\nThere are only a couple gripes I have. Very minor, but as it affects the gameplay itself, it feels rather sad to mention. I play this game for the story and music, but the gameplay was never all that engaging to me. Each of the fights had meperforming the same tactics, only changed by which boss I was going to face next. The bosses in this game are juggernauts, and it feels like they were only padded out just so that the in-fight dialogue could be heard. It just felt like there was too much health, and sometimes there were some really messed up moments between the AI and the bosses that just left you with almost nothing you could do (Hyodo without any tables left is a notable jerk that's for sure).\n\nOverall I enjoyed it, though. Still trying to get through merciless mode, which is its own can of worms, but I still quite enjoy it.",

        "content": "P5S is a fun follow-up to P5/P5R in the form of a 3D beat-em-up. Giant waves of enemies come at you and there's occasionally a boss who does big damage yet can be stunned for your own big damage if you hit it's weakness enough. Sounds like Persona/SMT gameplay in an action environment? You'd be correct.\n\nThere's balance issues with characters strengths and weaknesses but it never forces you into a unwinnable situation; plus the balance between Persona elements and beat-em-up elements was more important and they succeeded there. You have to keep an eye on your skills mostly for stronger enemies and to improve combos but if you're exceedingly talented at these kinds of games you could ignore it...but the system is fun so there's no reason to. The story is a bit shallow with our returning cast while the new faces (at least the good guys) get character development that's pretty logical and nice, but it probably won't leave the biggest impression on you. It's moreso a reason to see Ren, Ryuji, Yusuke, Makoto, Futaba etc. again and get what would be confidant cut-scenes in P5 but stretched through the whole game. The game is  gorgeous and despite it being frantic I would stop after clearing an area to look around. I was worried when the characters looked a little off when it was revealed but they look fine in-game alongside the demons and levels you'll explore.\n\nIt's a fun sequel that doesn't push the envelope outside of introducing RPG menus and abilities to Samurai Warriors like gameplay. If you like Persona 5 it's a great. simple and significantly shorter. It allows extra time with the Phantom Thieves too, especially Haru! and don't worry - one thief won't take up a ton of the main plot this time. Makoto, I'm staring lazers at you. Gameplay design also feels similar despite the new combat style as managing your abilities before heading into a jail is where the real challenge comes in and then using those abilities sparingly. It's fun and enjoyable, do consider getting it!\n\nIf you don't like P5...you'll think it's pretty I guess. It's another warriors game with the ability to do an attack from a menu that does more damage. I do think unless you are *really* into the game's art style, you could do better with other games on Steam.",

        "content": "First things first this game is not a sequel to be taken lightly and is far from shallow or \"easy going\" compared to the original game as claimed by some reviewers. The rest of the Persona spin-off titles pale in comparison to this masterpiece truly worthy of the Persona title. I wouldn't even call this a spin-off but this is a true sequel in my books.\n\nThe games \"social\" system might not be as deep as in the original game but for what it's worth it does its job well letting you do optional quests for your companions and encounter in optional dialouge during your spare time and you'll be constantly interacting with you companions throughout the story.\n\nIf you have played the original Persona 5 Game this is a must play. A true masterpiece with a deep plot and good mechanics\n\noverview:\n+ Deep and well crafted engaging plot that is simply outstanding\n+ Combat is very fun and at times very engaging\n+ Persona Creation and modification feature is well crafted and goes as deep as you're willing to go\n+ Atmosphere and environments are outstanding\n+ soundtrack is excellent\n+ Character encounters throughout the game are enchanting and deep",

I miss the pace of the RPG, and maybe I haven't really given the game system enough of a chance, yet.  Art/music is spot on - but I'll need to sit down and just play it thru a bit more - and maybe I'll be able to love it, too.",

        "content": "\"iT's SMT WiThOuT tHe hEaRt aND a DaSh oF dYnAsTy wArRiOrS.\" - IGN 2021.\n\nThe story/setting:\nThis game continues the story line from the original Persona 5 ending. It follows Joker and the Phantom Thieves as they traverse around Japan during their summer vacation with many exciting locales and palaces (jails) to explore and fight through! Anyone who has played the previous titles (P5/P5R) will understand many of the references made in this title.\n\nGameplay:\nCombat has been changed from turn based to a more dynasty warriors-esque 1 vs 100 type deal but still having the familiar persona combat system implemented in its RPG predecessor. Each member of the phantom thieves have their own unique persona to level up and as well as melee combos to learn which can be quite satisfying. Being able to see each member of the phantom thieves in combat fighting shadows alongside Joker is quite pleasing. Each individual character have a \"show-time\" ability that is built up through combat and it acts as a ultimate skill from each character's specific personas.\n\nWhile it took a little time to get used to, using personas in combat can be quite hectic since combat quite fast paced and would be more difficult if not for the time freeze when aiming skills over an area of enemies. Anyone who has played previous Persona or SMT titles will be familiar with the weakness system. Additionally fusion of personas (or  demons) returns again in this title with a more simplified system than it's predecessors.\n\nRPG elements:\nA lot of the social interactions between individual characters have been stripped out, in favor of a bond system that levels up and gives points for you to allocate into improving the phantom thieves team abilities as a whole. While there are still group events and small hang out events between characters that give you bond points and additional rewards for completing them all of the romance and dating systems in the main line games have been completely removed.\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers is a perfectly balanced game that takes the RPG elements of its predecessors and implements it well into a dynasty warriors type of game. While I do wish that social links were still a part of this game, the gameplay and story will easily keep any persona/SMT fan entertained for over 70 - 80 hours long depending on how much of a completionist you are.",

        "content": "Haru gets more screen time, so yeah, it's good. \n\nStrikers is a direct sequel to 5 and since Atlus are dumb lazy cunts that hate money, you will need to emulate 5 vanilla on rpcs3 before you play this. \n\nStrikers is not a turn-based rpg like the previous game, it's purely an action game, similar to Dynasty Warriors. I usually hate musou shit, but this one is pretty fun. The combat is neat and i really enjoyed the way you use your personas powers in real time with combos to counter enemy weaknesses, just like the turn-based game.\n\nAnyway, Strikers is a worthy sequel. If you enjoyed Persona 5 characters and story you will definitely enjoy this one too.",

I really like the Persona series, but this game just didn't do it for me. The story was boring, the cities were empty with nothing to do, the gameplay was just a warriors game. I spent not even 35 hours playing the game and when I was playing it I just wasn't really enjoying it. The soundtrack is the one thing that I don't have any issue with, its pretty good. But if you really like the Persona series, sure go ahead and buy it. And if its on sale for like $30 or under then sure, go ahead and buy it. But like man I was expecting so much more from the game because of all the advertising and hype it got. The main thing I wish it had done was added stuff to do in the cities, like mainline Persona games have done.",

The story is alright, but the characters are a bit one-note and often feel more like tropes than characters. It's hard to explain, but I've been playing on and off since launch and still haven't finished. I just haven't had the desire to play. The game runs pretty good, although it is locked at 60FPS. \n\nIf you like warriors games, definitely pick it up. Otherwise I'd wait for a good sale. I think 30-40 dollars is good. My only huge complaint is the difficulty. Easy feels way too easy but normal feels a bit too hard- I wish there was something in the middle.",

It is important to note that some fights are way easy even on hard mode because of the area damage that all the attacks do, but as always you cant just simply spam the same, you will run out if stamina, so that keeps the strategic side of the franchise alive, and I'm glad of that. \n\nThe soundtrack is fabulous as always",

        "content": "Excellent game.  It's a really good blend of Persona meets Dynasty Warriors with a little more strategy involved (like having abilities that enemies are weak to will greatly help keep you alive or beat enemies.)\n\nNot only is this game super fun to play, but the story that goes with it is also really good.  The only downside to the story is that some people might be a little lost of what's going on in terms of characters and stories, mainly because this game deals with a time period after Persona 5.  \n\nI would love to see more games exactly like this, or even a sequel to this game.  Just hoping this helps bring Persona 5 to PC so that other people can enjoy that game and relate to this game a little more!",

It felt like it was retreading the story beats from Persona 5 and Royal. Although I'll be the firs to admit that saying that is kind of reductive on my part. Not a deal breaker for me, but I think it's worth noting. \n\nPlay it. It's alright, I guess.",

The combat feels like a fun departure from Persona's turn-based combat while still remaining true to staple mechanics like exploiting weaknesses, One More, and All Out Attacks.\n\nThe story is also very fun, and it's great getting to see all the characters interact with each other. The individual plots for each \"dungeon\" do feel a little samey so far, but that isn't enough to detract from the charm and amazing rapport the Phantom Thieves have with each other.",

        "content": "Anyone familiar with the Warriors games will have a rough understanding of what to expect. But this time around the Persona mechanics are integrated quite well, making it a very different experience than any Warriors game before it - if anything, the much larger number of enemies than normal for a Persona game necessitates a stronger focus on the weakness system in order to maintain an advantage. And yes, Persona collection and fusion are still core mechanics as well. Overall, it lends itself to using very different tactics than a normal Persona game, and combinations I wouldn't have really bothered with outside of this game. The story and cutscenes are completely faithful to what one would expect of Persona, and I felt were very fulfilling.\n\nThat being said, I will say the boss design is a bit weak - the major bosses do have unique mechanics and do feel unique, but the fights drag a bit and begin to feel stale with the amount of hp they have. The minor bosses don't have the benefit of unique mechanics to offset the hp-spongeness.",

        "content": "P5S is a sequel/ spinoff of Persona 5, and its pretty good. The question I see about this game all the time is \"do I need to play Base Persona 5 to play this one?\" and yeah, I think you should. It takes place directly after, and while they don't touch on the story of P5 often, you still miss a lot of information on the characters and world, and if you go back to P5 later, a lot of stuff will be spoiled for you. Its not MANDITORY by any means, but enhances the game considerably. \n\nWith that out of the way, the game itself is a hack and slash game similar to the Warriors Series. And this is the first game with that combat I've consistently enjoyed. I've played Fire Emblem Warriors and Hyrule Warriors, and both of them get really REALLY boring after so many hours, but P5S keeps it fresh the whole way through, and is the only of this kind of game I've gone and 100%ed. The Demon Fusion elements from SMT are still present, but have been watered down considerably. This was a downside for me, but if you found the system tedious, this could be a good thing for you. Unless you're going for full completion, there is minimal grinding in this game, and the different ways to improve are all satisfying and fun to keep up with. The social aspect is all gone and the story is very streamlined, which makes it feel a lot less \"persona-y\" and the story is generally far more simple than anything else you'll see in this series, but the game never pretends to be more than it is. If you're coming for a simple button masher with some familiar faces and a cool world. you're in the right spot. But if you want a game that will make you feel the same way previous Persona games did, you're in the wrong spot. Overall if you liked P5 and want more. I'd recommend checking this one out. 6/10",

And when it comes to the Musou the mechanics are pretty bare bones. Which, of course, ain't that bad - But that's a big hit or miss with a ton of people.\n2. There is no story choices. Romance, social links, mini-games? None here, bub.\n3. It's really a story that doesn't need to be told.\n4. The music is bumping.\n\nPersona 5 is great. But this extra filler? Even the most die hard fans I think will be semi-let down over it. For example, Sophia and Old Man Zenkichi are not very charming. Finally, it has some of the lame changes of heart ever... Including someone semi-copying other peoples manga tropes and adding them to his own stupid manga. I would advise you watch a YouTube for about an thirty minutes of gameplay just to see if it's for you.\n\n",

        "content": "This is persona 5 light fused with a mus\u00f4. \n\nFirst, I would strongly recommend coming here after playing the original persona 5 or better persona 5 royal (even though in this case some elements would not be cannon with this story). First, it is a sequel / OVA so starting by the second entry is a bit silly, second a good half of the persona experience is your link with its cast of characters so, even if most of the mechanics of the story are re-explained, you would miss a lot a things, and persona 5 is one of the best games of last generation sooo...\n\nAnyway, presentation wise, exactly like its predecessor, this game is pristine, beautiful, inspired and varied environments, the music (again) is awesome, great animation works... It just radiates quality.\nSame thing in the writing department, the characters are as endearing as ever, and the additions to the thieves are very welcome, but the plot is a tad predictable sometimes.\nThe problem arises in the gameplay department, the moment-to-moment gameplay is clearly an experiment here, sometimes fighting can be tedious because of the stuck camera, lack of clarity, and the amount of enemies / time to dispatch them\u2026 when it\u2019s good it is really good you dodge and weave through the enemies with grace\u2026 until nothing shows you that another enemy is about to one shot from behind\u2026 Also, some jails (think palaces in p5) are a bit too big and revisiting them can be a bit tedious. The fusion system is a bit more tedious with level requirement for fusions components. And for the out of jail part, it is good, the confident system has been replaced by a much simpler system that allows you to unlock bonuses by collecting points doing requests (simple quests), after story event and during fighting, simpler but fitting for this much simpler game.\nAnyway, it is a quality game with some gameplay inconsistencies, though even though it is less good than its mainline entry, I enjoyed it a great deal and if you liked p5 you should too! Though I would really love to see another iteration on these mechanics, a p6s maybe? \nAnyway, it\u2019s time for you to tear your mask out, right?",

That being said even if you haven't had the chance to play the original because its not on pc, this game still stands on its own as a fun game with a compelling story. For a 3D hack and slash style game P5S is middle of the road in terms its combat. The music is amazing with some new music mixed with remixes of some tracks from the original game. This game does however lack a lot of real challenge. If you are someone looking for a game that will challenge you this is probably not a game for you.",

(Playing this without playing Persona 5 will leave you utterly lost though so go play Persona 5 now) \n\nComparatively, you get another 3/4 of a game of Persona 5 story and character interaction.  You get another new 3/4 of a excellent Persona 5 soundtrack and some arranged returning tracks.  All the new battle music is amazing as usual.  Voice acting is top notch.  No social links and the persona and fusion lineup is pared down, but it's no big deal.  \n\nGameplay is decent.  It's a Musou game by the Dynasty Warriors people but does not feel swarmy or button mashy most of the time.  Even on normal difficulty not paying attention to the enemy movements and resistances will get you killed as enemies can hit like trucks.  There's more focus on killing large minibosses over swarms of enemies.  And the big bosses are pretty fun.",

        "content": "Just about everything I loved about both Personas 5 and Royal is transplanted into Strikers. The charming characters, the story, the vibrant menus, and the music combine with a new combat system that disposes of turn-based, RPG-style fighting in favor of a more frenetic, real-time, one vs. 1,000 format that still makes you feel like you\u2019re playing a Persona game.\n\nPut the Phantom Thieves in damn near anything, and I\u2019ll show up. They\u2019re so well-written, realistic-sounding and mature. And they\u2019ve grown from when we last met them, showing empathy to their adversaries. You\u2019ll cheer when they get their big damn hero moment. How could I not take the opportunity to spend another 100 hours with these kids? And on a cross-Japan road trip too? Say less.\n\nIt\u2019s almost unfair to call Strikers a musou game, despite being one, as it doesn\u2019t feel like a Dynasty Warriors game at all. For as much as I love Koei Tecmo\u2019s tentpole action series, Strikers\u2019 combat is too slick and too varied, and too stylistically Persona to be called a typical musou. And I think it\u2019s that combat that saves an otherwise sparsely appointed game.",

There is so much fun tidbits that makes the cast and humor funny. I love the characters, writing, and visuals. The styles and humor makes the whole game colorful for me. I hope Persona 5 royal will come out on PC someday. This game felt like a little fanservice that touched my heart after Persona 5 Royal. Please keep up the great work developers!",

Only reason P5 is good cause of its Gameplay and soundtrack, story is boring in Strikers, Royal, and original P5. Time to go play P4G again :)",

        "content": "[h1] They should have gone all in. [/h1]\n\nThis is a game that exudes adequacy. Everything is where it needs to be in order to sell a game people play and, at the end of their session, say \"wow, that was a unique and interesting game\" without actually paying it any mind. The reality of the situation, however, is a bit more grim.\n\nWe should start by giving this game kudos for TRYING to implement mouse and Keyboard support. For a W-Force product to do this, you know someone else was involved forcing it to happen. No, on to the short and sweet as to why I would not recommend this game:\n\n[b] Replayability is almost nonexistent [/b]\n\nThere's not much more to say. You are trapped in a linear storyline with horribly restrictive and boring free-roam [b] elements. [/b] Outside of that, it is just you doing missions with a main character who, while wildly loved by the series' respective fans, is not the reason people play Warrior games. To have a single-digit number of characters that can be played, and only after some time, in a title like this is embarrassing and really highlights the shortcomings of the rest of the game.\n\n[b] Artistic style is not an excuse for fun. [/b]\n\nAt the end of the day, a fresh coat of paint isn't an excuse for a lack of content. It looks very pretty, yes. True to the series for artistic choice? Yes. Does it add anything else? No. It seems the majority of production on this game went into pressing out another story in the Persona Universe without actually making the game around the new action-based mechanics.\n\nDon't get it unless you merely want to continue the Persona fandom.",

        "content": "It's a sequel with great story and an actual continuation to the original Persona 5's (also great) story, but of course doesn't play like the original game. It is by no means easier either, as the game can be insanely difficult even on Normal mode, making Hard mode almost impossible to complete. Without doing extra side stuff like requests, or secret bosses the game might only take about 20 hours to complete, which my play-through with doing those things (plus some save scumming for specific side objectives) i finished the game at around 35 hours, which is not reflected in my Steam playtime as I was alt-tabbed out of the game a lot. I've not played many Musou games (only two being both Hyrule Warriors spin-offs as well) but for a crowd fighting game it's really weird the most you'll fight at a time is 3-15 enemies, with bigger crowds only available in scripted events, filled with generic no weakness enemies.",

        "content": "An okay Persona spinoff game and a barely passable port. I would prefer to give this a mixed review over a negative review, but people only read the negative reviews.\n\nIf you're buying this, then you have probably already played P5/P5R (and if you haven't, there's really nothing here for you). It's pretty much just a lot of fan service tied together with an okay story, which is fine if that's what you're looking for. The gameplay loop is novel at first if you're coming from the slow, turnbased combat of the mainline games, but gets very boring and repetitive towards the later half of the game. I used Cheat Engine to get more XP and lowered the difficulty because the game expects you to grind to level up all your characters even on the lowest difficulty, which is frankly silly. \n\nThe fanservice is enjoyable, but they cheaped out on a lot of the smaller interactions. For example, in mainline Persona 5, if you ate ramen with Ryuji in your free time, there'd be at least some action-figure-like animations accompanying you eating ramen. In this game, it just gives you a black screen with Ryuji telling you how delicious the ramen is. It's not great, but this is only for the minor interactions and nothing else really reaches that level of laziness.\n\nThat said, if you understand this is just a spinoff with none of the major Persona mechanics and just want to have more time with the Phantom Thieves, this might be worth it- on sale.",

        "content": "TLDR: I don't like the gameplay loop, its too boring and redundant, but I like scenes where the gang hanging out and once the new story start rolling. There's something lacking on the gameplay loop, I find it hard to gather motivation to comeback to this game.\n\nI'm a huge Persona fans so I'm a bit sad I can't like this game, I tried to push the end because I want to see what's the story had to offer. This is not a bad game, its a decent game but I need to push my self to finish it unlike other Persona games.\n\n[h2]Good story and Character[/h2]\nOne of the good aspect in this game is the story, it's not as good as P5 Royal's third semester but it's an enjoyable story. It started with formulaic story but after the monotonous story done, it's an enjoyable story. The new cast on this game is the highlight of this game, his story is good and enjoyable, it had soul and might touch your heart. I really enjoy his story.\n\n[h2]Great Music[/h2]\nI like the soundtrack of this game, my favorite one is \"Daredevil\" and \"Counter Strike\". This game had really good music like you would expect from any persona games. The music gives so much vibe in this game, for example the \"Daredevil\" is feel like \"I'm stylishly unstoppable\" when striking toward towers and \"Counter Strike\" feel like \"a smooth badass\". It's pretty good\n\n[h2]This is a decent game for returning fans, but its not a good game for new comers[/h2]\nThis game contains every team member already finished their character development on P5 so there's no many growth worth mentioning, many stuff in this game will appeal to the fans but might confuse new comer.\n\n[h2] There's a good mechanic, but gameplay wise, I can't say many good thing about it[/h2]\nThere's a good mechanic like allowing you to swap to previously learned skill on your persona and cooking. I'm a huge Persona fans and find this entry quite underwhelming. It's still feel like Persona 5, character and story wise its good but gameplay wise is meh.\n\n[h2]SP & HP management is bad in this game[/h2]\nOne of the most fun challange in Persona game is HP and SP management and this spin off made it a nuisance. On the original game, you need to manage your resource efficiently, if you fail to do so you'll lost 1 day worth of free time it's a pretty clever mechanic. On this spin off there's no penalty, to recover your resource just simply go out and go to dungeon again while doing it you need to watch 3 loading screen, it's such a pain to do. This game should've had 1 button to recover HP & SP instead of doing that stupid clunky way.\n\n[h2]Decent UI, bad UX[/h2]\nI hate the UX in this game. The UI is decent but the UX is bad. The most obvious thing is unskippable transition, it such a spit in the face to the original P5 UX. To do something you need to watch TRANSITION, it's unskipable and slow it makes doing everything in the main menu feel sluggish, I hate it. It's so bad compared to P5 which is very concise, stylish, responsive, fast and clearly designed with player in mind. Pretty sure the designer in this game should learn from Masayoshi Sutoh and Hisayoshi Kijima (the UI designer of Persona 5 and Nier: Automata).\n\n[h2]Stripped Velvet Room[/h2]\nThe velvet room is a stripped down version of the original, I don't like it. It feels limited and it lacks the charm of the velvet room.\n\n[h2]The Persona skill is not well designed and battle is a bit mindless[/h2]\nA simple case: \"maragi\" previously it used to attack fire to all enemy in front of you, this lead to many interesting decision like:\n[list]\n[*] \"should I save sp or damage everyone with fire?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that drain fire, is it worth to attack everything but some of them gain health?\"\n[*] \"there's a deamon that reflect fire, is it worth to attack everything but I take damage?\"\n[*] \"should I finish this battle in 1 turn or wait for the next few turn?\"\n[*] etc\n[/list]\nBut in this game, maragi just simply attack wider range. It doesn't effect anything, there's no interesting decision its just a mindless skill. This not only happen to maragi skill but happen to buff/debuff and the gambling hama skill. The battle on this game is a bit mindless, I'm not saying P5 is hard but it had many interesting decision during its battle and I feel there's no such decision being made while I play this game.\n\n[h2]Conslusion[/h2]\nIf you like persona games, I would bet you'll like the story of this game. If you really want to know what's happen, go a head and play it. I don't like the gameplay and if you can't stand mindless gameplay and nuisance that I mentioned above, IMO its not worth it to push through it and better with watching youtube gameplay.\n\n[h2]Final Score: 2/5[/h2]",

        "content": "Hello  there  ,  hope you are doing well  . I have finished the game but for some reason I forgot to write a review for this amazing game . So , let me begin by saying that if you haven't played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal ,stay way  from this game at all costs  if you don't want your experience to be ruined (If you have specific questions about that ask  me in the comments and i will  try to explain  as much  spoiler free as possible) . Since  I am afraid that I might spoil  something and the fact that  English is not my mother tongue language , I will be short  :\nPros  : \n- Soundtrack :  Even though  this is a sequel/spin off and clearly I thought that the budget is gonna be less , I expected that  the quality  would not be as good as Persona 5/Royal , the game absolutely  destroyed my negative expectations . I can safely say that the quality of the different songs of  this game were on par with the soundtrackk of Persona 5 if not better . And  Lyn Inaizumi with her superb tone and really good control on the high notes, a great overall performance as always . Give her some love please on Twitter .\n- Engine : I really don't know what Engine did they use on Persona 5 strikers but  the textures for characters ,objects,game terrain are light  years more clean than the  Persona 5 Royal (which have a slight upgrade on it's graphics in comparison with  the vanilla Persona 5) . And  even though this is anime or as some smart people like to say it ''a weeb'' game , the game looks soooooooo good in 4K  60 fps and everything  on the highest  settings to the  point that I could not believe it . \n-Gameplay: At first ,  when it first was announced for the Japanese market I thought that the gameplay will be  broken , poorly made or whatever you want to call . And I was sure (for some reason) that this type  of gameplay will absolutely not  fit well on a Persona game so decided to ignore it since I believed that it won't have a Western release . After some time when the game was announced for the West , I decided  to take the risk (due to my bias towards the Persona franchise and Atlus)  and preorder the digital deluxe . So the early access released  and  I started playing . Not only it is not boring  but it also has so many many creative mechanics that build on the Dynasty Warriors gameplay  formula and make it wayyyyy more fun  than I expected and it  felt so good using the different new  mechanics  .\n-Story (SPOILER FREE) : Even though I have the bias i already mentioned above  ,  I never expected the story of this spin off (which also servers a sequel to Persona 5) to be so well crafted . Of course , not as big (that\u2019s what she said) and good as the Persona but so much better than your everyday spinn off \n-Duration/NG+ : First of all , the playtime I currently have is not  accurate because I have spent  1-2 hours looking  at the preorder bonuses . Also this is the duration of my first playthough and I haven't started yet NG+ .  NG+  is neccessary if you want to earn al the achievements . I am the type of player that likes to look every nook and cranny of the game , unlock  all the abilities for the characters , do all the side quests first  and then start doing the main story to unlock new side quests (and repeat ) until I finish the game  . \n Cons: \nThe only  thing I didn't like was the epilogue(it was rushed in my opinion but it probably they didn't have the apropriate budget to make it  smoother , I can't be  sure )  and fact that [spoiler] you can predict after a certain point  in the main story who the main antagonist is so I wish they would have hidden this person  better but it didn't bother me that much . Don't make that stop you from buying it , it is just my personal whining [/spoiler]\n\nOoof , I wrote more than I expected . Before  I  leave please leave  a comment if you  have anything to ask before buying in the comments . Have a great day and stay safe !!!!!!",

        "content": "The first Persona game I have played was 5.  it was fun at first but as you go you realize every enemy fights the exact same and every single battle is the exact same tactic.  Tactic, strategy what ever you want to call your plan in battle is the exact same every fight, hold R1 to find a weakness on an enemy to get an \"all out attack\" to build your special, or \"showtime\" meter.  I cant finish the game because it became so mundane and endless talking and cutscene's.  Every time you encounter an enemy they have to talk to you first then change their form into what you'll fight, which is also confusing why they all have one form to speak and one to fight in.  \n\nI think these games are over hyped and end up long over staying their welcome.  If it had an intelligent combat system and intuitive and changing enemy types it would be far more engaging.  Not for me personally.  I'll stick to the God of Wars when i need some melee story telling exerperience and you should save your money and not get this dull game.  Having forced myself to attempt to finish this game I'm calling it quits at 44 hours in.  Use me as a lesson and not your wallet.",

        "content": "I absolutely love [i]Persona 5[/i], it\u2019s actually one of my all-time favorites, and I remember how I wished for a direct sequel after I finished it. Never would have imagined that my wish would come true!\n\nWell, sort of, at least. Story-wise, [i]Persona 5 Strikers[/i] is indeed a sequel (although most of the side characters from [i]P5[/i] are absent, and don\u2019t expect to develop/continue any romantic relationships, either), however, the battle system is quite different this time around. I, for one, wasn\u2019t a huge fan of this new, active, real-time combat. Sure, you can get used to it pretty fast, it\u2019s not very difficult, controls are pretty fluid, and it can definitely be fun obliterating huge hordes of enemies \u2013 it\u2019s just that I, personally, have always preferred turn-based battles in JRPGs. \n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, there\u2019s nothing I could complain about. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, including all the beautiful anime cutscenes, the story is meaningful (although maybe a bit weaker than in [i]P5[/i]) filled with relatable characters, and the music\u2026 God, I loved the music, just like in all [i]Persona[/i] games I\u2019ve played so far! Admittedly, most of the songs are from [i]P5[/i], but I didn\u2019t mind that at all. I\u2019m telling you, the soundtracks of these games are incredible.\n\nAll in all, even if you\u2019re like me and are a bit intimidated by the battle system, I think you should give this one a try. There are less social interactions than in [i]P5[/i], no minigames, less characters, but in exchange, you get more cities to explore, [spoiler]and even some new Phantom Thieves![/spoiler]",

        "content": "EDIT October of 2022: Persona 5 has just been released on PC. I highly recommend playing through it first before Strikers.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a sequel/spinoff to Persona 5. Unlike it's predecessor which was a turn based jrpg with dungeon crawler/social sim elements, Strikers is an action hack and slash game in the vein of Dynasty Warriors.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this game is how familiar to Persona 5 it feels. It has so many little touches like the player being able to pause the game and view the dialogue log mid conversation. All of the player's companions return from the original which is a very welcome inclusion. As a huge fan of Persona 5's story and characters the primary selling point for this game was being able to continue the adventures of Joker and the gang. Which this game delivers. On the flipside this is also potentially the game's greatest shortcoming. It's a direct sequel to Persona 5 and fully expects you to have beaten that game before playing this one. Considering Persona 5 isn't on Steam (as of the writing of this review anyway) this is a massive problem. Because of that if you haven't previously played P5 or P5R you will be rather lost in terms of the story and general gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe action rpg combat is serviceable albeit very simple. It feels kind of mindless at times and selectively makes you pay attention when it throws a challenging enemy at you. It does feel like the developers did their best to try and make an action rpg out of Persona 5's combat. However I never felt like it ever surpassed that game in terms of strategy or personality. I can see this game appealing to people who were turned off of Persona 5's turn based combat. However because it's story expects you to have beaten P5 it also doesn't really appeal to newcomers. \n\nAll in all in terms of being a spinoff/sequel to Persona 5 it delivers. It gives you more of that game just with a different spin on things. Outside of that though if you weren't crazy about the original like I was it's hard to recommend. Especially since Persona 5 isn't on Steam as of yet. Hopefully if/when that game releases, Strikers can have a second wind on Steam. But til then it remains as a novelty for the minority of PS4 owners who own a gaming PC and were also huge fans of Persona 5.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers overall does a fantastic job of bringing P5's characters and gameplay to a whole new style of combat.  Fights are smooth, the combos are satisfying, and it still feels like Persona combat.  Elemental affinities are still present, and Joker can freely swap between available Personas.  Every playable character feels unique and has a moveset I feel accurately represents them.  For example, Morgana can transform into his car form seen in Mementos, and several of Makoto's combos involve riding Johanna or rapid punches.  The story overall was pretty good and helped make this still feel like a Persona game.  The Phantom Thieves are rather static characters compared to the original game, but instead they help others find their own way, especially the two new members of the Thieves.  However the first few Jails can feel rather...samey and formulaic.  It doesn't help that every boss fight takes place in a castle.  It loses some of the uniqueness seen in P5's Palaces.  I also don't think the Jail Monarchs have the same impact as Palace rulers, but there were good ones.  \n\nOne major returning part of the game to really tie it back to the Persona series is the Velvet Room.  Lavenza alone manages it this time as Igor is nowhere to be seen.  And this was honestly what I felt to be the weakest part of the game.  Especially coming nearly fresh off of Persona 5 Royal, the Velvet Room felt very bare bones.  Persona Fusion works in pretty much the same way, but there's not much else.  You gain the ability to level your Personas directly up to Joker's current level with a new currency, but it gets very expensive very quickly.  Not helped are the new restrictions that the Personas themselves now must be at a certain level to be fused.  This wasn't a big deal in the early game, but trying to get powerful Personas in the late game was a chore as they often required Personas acquired in early Jails to be at a level far past when they stop learning new skills.  For example, King Frost requires Jack Frost and Jack-o-Lantern to be at level 40 while Joker to be at level 66.  But Jack-o-Lantern might be around level 8.  So the only way to get him the extra levels is to spend the new persona points.  But I at least could not find a reliable way of getting them besides re-summoning and dismissing high level Personas.  Gaining new Personas in the field is random; there is a chance a defeated Shadow will drop a mask for Joker, and that chance can be increased by leveling a skill.  Repeated Personas will give persona points instead of exp like in P5.\n\nOverall this is still a very fun game with fantastic music and a decent story, but I think Persona 5 Royal is the more polished experience.  But for a spin-off sequel in a totally different genre?  It did a great job.\n\nOne last note: the digital deluxe edition is slightly misleading.  The art gallery and OST are locked in a separate application with no built-in way to download the contents.",

        "content": "Calling this game a spinoff of Persona 5 would be a disservice. Despite a huge difference in gameplay Persona 5 Strikers feels more like a proper sequel. Not only that but I can wholeheartedly say that I had more fun with P5S than with the vanilla Persona 5.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, at its core, is a Musou type game with Persona mechanics. Meaning, a hack'n'slash with hundreds of enemies and some RPG elements. And surprisingly such combination works very well. The production values are quite impressive, with a brand new story reuniting the Phantom Thieves together, as well as introducing some well-developed new characters. The way the characters interact feels like a proper Persona game, and while the core story isn't anything groundbreaking, it is still very well presented, with some nice twists here and there. Honestly, I think I enjoyed the story more than the vanilla Persona 5, mainly because the characters we interact with are not just simple one-dimensional villains like in the original.\n\nDespite lacking the social-life aspect of previous Persona titles, many other elements unique to that series are present in Strikers. And the action-oriented gameplay works very well with them. Kind of brings back memories of the Devil Summoner series from the PS2, only better and even more dynamic. With several different playable and customizable characters, as well as dozens of Personas to fuse for the main character, the hack'n'slash gameplay doesn't get tedious too fast. Mashing buttons won't get you far, as there's still a need to be tactical and aware of enemies' affinities. That said, even though I'm no action game expert, I've found the controls to be very intuitive and comfortable. Rarely had any issues controling the characters or running around the environment.\n\nThe game looks and sounds great. The style is very similar to Persona 5, and the new music is very catchy, whether in battle, dungeons, or during free-time. Environments are numerous and varied. This goes for both the dungeons and the Japanese cities the party visits during their trip.\nThe game runs at 60fps and the PC port is honestly surprisingly good. Never had a single technical issue and the game ran very smoothly with no frame drops whatsoever.\n\nWhereas the original Persona 5, for me, got tedious very fast, I've found Persona 5 Strikers way more enjoyable. To the point I've started the New Game + on the highest difficulty only to appreciate it even more. Sure, there are some flaws, obviously, but my point is that the game is really good and every fan of Persona 5 should give it a try. Other people maybe not so much, mainly because Strikers is a direct sequel to Persona 5, which I'd suggest either play or watch beforehand.\n\nOverall, a great game that doesn't deserve to be called a spinoff, because it's much more than that. I've had tons of FUN with Strikers and I'm pretty sure I'll replay it again someday.",

Rather than being the typical turn based it is all real time. My complaint about this system is that there isn\u2019t much variety in the move sets. The story is overall pretty good, not the best but still very enjoyable. The OST is S tier per usual when it comes to a persona game with some twists on some of the classic Persona 5 songs giving them some extra flair and energy that felt much needed for a musou game. In one of the dungeons I did experience a really bad bug, which caused the game to freeze a ton. It did hinder my enjoyment in the game and I do hope it was fixed. Other than that, I believe it to be a solid game",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an interesting mix of Persona 5 story, characters and lore with the typical Dynasty Warriors gameplay (haven't played any dynasty warriors yet). Whether you like this game or not will depend on what you liked in Persona 5 more, which is either the life-sim/story or the gameplay or both. \n\nAlso btw, this is a full-on sequel to Persona 5 (not Royal) so I would highly recommend playing that one first. Not just because it gives you more insight into the characters but it is also a better put together game, albeit with its weaknesses which P5S has seemed to borrowed over as well.\n\nIt is definitely a game made for people who have played and fell in love with Persona 5 before. Great music, great characters (new ones too) with an interesting amalgamation of both the combat styles, but highly leaning towards the use of Personas in the active battlefield. I was no longer waiting 120 seconds per turn to think about my next 3 moves, like what I would do in Persona 5. Now you have to make split second decisions, but you can always open up the persona menu mid-battle to pause time and think about your strategy a bit. Some levels are poorly balanced so feel free to adjust the difficulty if you retry more than twice on a mission, unless you are in it for the challenge.\n\n1. My biggest problem with this game is the same problem that I had with P5.\n\nThe story and the pace of it is just too slow at some points especially in the middle, where you feel like the story is not progressing anywhere and we are basically waiting for something to happen/give us a clue. Some dungeons are just too big, and they throw the same enemy types at you and you steamroll through them till you reach a boss which spices up some things but largely uses the same skills, tactics etc. Lots of potential here to make you feel burned out and bored if you figure out some strategies which work in the short term.\n\n2. My second biggest problem, I don't think the game puts enough emphasis on using persona skills that automatically trigger when you execute a particular combo. This is especially helpful with Joker since he is the most versatile one and using the skills in combos drains 0 SP, so you still get some chance to retaliate at low SP. It's basically a weakened version of a skill but takes no SP. SP is still a rarely found resource in the game and especially when there is no checkpoints to save your progress and refresh your SP in sight.\n\n3. Third, I feel the story and dungeons were too repetitive and simplistic this time. The story repeated itself for 3-4 dungeons (these were the long ones too imo). Go to the dungeon, chase the red marker, kill everything that stands in your way. I saw this in P5 as well so I think it carried on from there but the most complex things that the dungeon crawling in P5 and P5S require from you are simple yet gloried fetch quests. I would have liked to see the dungeon crawling requires at least 10% of my brain power to clear through them.\n\n4. This point is deriving info heavily from the P5 story so most of this is in spoiler territory. [spoiler]The plot lacks originality. The story is pretty similar to P5 (the characters say that they have seen this happen themselves). The bosses have more backstory this time so that's nice but still it seems pretty formulaic by the time the story tries to create suspense because the pacing issues I mentioned up there. Zenkichi and Sophia are welcome additions to the crew however. I think Zenkichi's addition should have happened sooner that it did because the plot picks up after that point quickly. The pacing issues is something I really hope ATLUS improves on because plenty of people just leave games when they get boring or some people just stop paying attention to the stuff going on (like me during the mid-game).[/spoiler]\n\nEven after all my criticisms, I feel this game deserves a genuine try by Persona fans because there's still plenty of things to love here, especially Persona 5 fans like me. I think I just bought this game for the UI as soon as it came it out :P",

Similarily to dancing all night it takes the persona characters you know and love, and expands the ever growing universe of persona 5. Great game as a follow up to P5 and P5R. If you like mowing through waves and waves of enemies (similar to hyrule warriors, or dynasty kings) you'll love this game and enjoy the enthralling story telling and wonderful voice acting.",

Same cast of good looking idiots as last time, plus a few new idiots. Good times.\n\nOn the one hand, lots of fun being able to eat as much food as you want while combat is paused.

Had a blast listening to the BG music while playing.\n     > The devs took the opportunity to flesh out some of the underdeveloped characters in P5/P5R and generally succeeded. The cast now feels more well-rounded.\n     > Road-tripping through Japan as the setting was great as I was familiar with several of the places the Phantom Thieves visited and it reminded me of how much I enjoyed my own trips.\n     [spoiler]> The devs did a helluva job in introducing and establishing the new Phantom Thieves Wolf and Sophie as relatable characters. Sophie in particular reminded me a lot of Vivi from FFIX in that her journey of learning and growth was also central to the story.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Things I'm meh about or disliked:[/h1]\n     > The combat mechanics were just ok for me. I settled into them more or less by halfway through the game but boss fights more or less devolved to P5-style of fighting - buff, spam elemental weakness, toss items around like crazy. Gimme the old turn-based combat any day.\n     > The slice of life stuff that really drew me into P5R felt lacking here. As mentioned previously, I wish the game leaned more into that especially since the original premise of P5 was supposedly a big jaunt around the world which Strikers is delivering on a smaller scale.\n     [spoiler]> The post-Kyoto storyline devolving into a retread of P5 was kinda disappointing. Konoe as Shido-adjace (even down to the boss fight mechanics), Demiurge being character-wise a repeat of Yaldabaoth, and the final 2 jails being Mementos-adjace left me a little let down by the final 3 or so hours of the game.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Overall: A good, almost-great sequel to P5.[/h1]",

        "content": "I was on the fence about this game at first. Yes, it is a continuation of P5 (one of my favorite JRPGs), but the choice of combat style a la Dynasty Warriors seemed a weird choice for me. Indeed, it took quite some getting used to at first. Many of the battles will present you with so much information on screen that it can be difficult to keep track of what is happening. Hordes of enemies swarm and remembering certain attack combos in unison with summoning your Persona felt like a feat in multitasking compared to the original combat of P5; though this may be more my lack of experience with hack and slash games if anything. Showtime attacks, which felt like more of an after-thought in Royal, return center stage akin to ultimate moves in combat, with each part member having their own unique set. Persona summoning is also incorporated into combat, with the ability to switch between your deck and cast spells as needed.\n\nHowever, after a while, the combat became fun once I grew accustom to the controls. Playing this on PC, I would highly recommend plugging in a controller over M&K. There was something satisfying in the flashy and stylish way each Phantom Thief performs in a fight. Beyond the main combat, it keeps to the series' traditional Persona fusing system (complete with Velvet Room), along with the same familiar abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Any veteran of the Persona will pick up on these with ease. \n\nThe gameplay takes place in various \"Jails,\" similar to Palaces where they are tied to and modeled after a particular boss. Even after completion, you can revisit each one to tie up loose ends such as obtaining a rare Persona or completing side jobs that will occasionally come in. Another change is lack of Confidants or daily social activities in favor of focusing largely on the main group. Because of this change, late additions to the party in P5, such as Futaba or Haru, receive a lot more screen time. \n\nIn terms of story, this game is a direct sequel to Persona 5 (vanilla, not Royal). The Phantom Thieves reunite to tackle another threat as they travel Japan in a grand road trip. The Metaverse returns and, unsurprisingly, someone is messing with it again. It follows much of the same structure as P5 in finding the current big bad, taking them down, and moving on to the next target. Strikers deviates from the main game in that you no longer have major hub areas to explore outside of the Metaverse. Most new location only come with minor exploration, with most of the meat being within the Jails themselves. In-game time is fast-tracked in comparison, with typically only a few 'days' between missions. No new formula here, but if you're looking for more Phantom Thieves goodness, this game will offer it. The game is not nearly as long as its predecessor; I finished at about 54 hours, which included a bit of time building my Persona team and tackling various side jobs/bosses. \n\nMost of the same beats are here: stylistic combat, great music, an engrossing story, and the same lovable cast of characters. There is not much more to say beyond that, as anyone coming out of P5 will feel at home here (at least once mastering the combat system). While not as grand as those of the main line games, it is a worthy sequel to try something new and help pass the time waiting for P6.",

Which is fine, because the old stuff is good.\n\nGameplay was enjoyable for me on Normal as somebody completely unfamiliar with Warriors / Musou games. Every character is pretty useful throughout, and identifying the best strategies for them is rewarding. Bosses can be pretty damage-spongy though, and you definitely will feel underleveled if you try those very-powerful-demon requests as soon as you get them.\n\nRan very well on my system, without any noticeable issues aside from one random crash. Game lets you save freely outside of dungeons and at any checkpoint within them, so impact of those can be minimal.",

These are no secret and you can easily find lots of reports and people asking for solutions on game own forums. Developer keeps releasing \"beta\" hotfixes, none of which fixed issues for me.\n\nI am not sure if these issues have something to do with poor support for AMD CPUs, generally poor multithreading stability (some fixes suggest issues with hyperthreading) or some issues with Denuvo DRM uses.\n\nAlso keep in mind these bugs tend to happen most on late game levels, at time where you are well past return window. I wonder if developer deliberately spent most time polishing start of the game to avoid refunds.\n\nEdit: After 13 additional hours, Steam suggested \"do you want to revise your review\".\nWell, I still don't recommend it. I managed to get through buggy stages, but it was super-frustrating, I had to redo couple very difficult boss fights when game decided to freeze on me.\n\nI somehow managed to get through by a lot of manual hacks by playing with CPU affinity, and later actually using Visual Studio debugger to un-stick the frozen game (having programmer background helped). Still I feel this was way above what average user can or should be able to deal with, so \"Not recommended\" verdict still stays.",

        "content": "While I do think the game is very good, the combat isn't as great as you might think. Most battles on higher difficulties turn into you spamming SP because there's no way in hell you're beating some of these bosses otherwise. Stronger moves cost a large amount of SP, unless you have certain Persona abilities. Be ready to chug sodas or other SP restoration items. I definitely advise playing on easy so the combat doesn't start to drag and bosses don't take a long time. The combo versions of spells just don't cut it.  At all. You'll either get knocked out of it or get it off and deal basically no damage. Combat basically comes down to this cycle: heat riser -> apply status -> spam technicals and/or weakness -> recover SP. I've tried several times to play the game any other way and the payoff is never worth it. The moment I got Spell Master, the other party members might as just not exist. \n\nOkay, now that the bummer part is out of the way. The story is great! The new characters fit in perfectly and I want more of them. The old cast bounce off of each other and the new characters very well! The music is incredible and a lot of boss designs and set pieces are really good. \n\nThe quality of life for Persona abilities is great and definitely should be added to the main games going forward. Merciless drops items that increase a stat by 1 so other party members can achieve 99 in all stats, which is pretty satisfying. Fusion is a little lack luster, requiring some persona to be very high leveled and there's just not that many to fuse. Persona take forever to level, and using the persona points system is really tedious. You essentially buy and release the same persona over and over to get more persona points. The ultimate persona is just Lucifer, which is a bummer given the potential of P5's ultimate Persona in this game.\n\nYou probably won't encounter these issues unless you play on hard or normal, and you'll definitely avoid most of the fusion issues if you aren't achievement hunting like I was. If you like Persona 5, you'll like this game. Simple as that.",

I'm not too far into the story but I think it has done well to incorporate aspects of real everyday life with EMMA being similar to other tech in the real world. Can't wait to play more and would 100% recommend it to anyone (though I'd suggest playing Persona 5 first because there are things you need to play/watch the prequel to understand)\n\nEdit 1: Finished the second jail and came to say that I LOVE the story, taking the persona 5 characters and placing them in positions that mirror their past selves is ingenious because it shows how the characters could have ended up before finding their real resolve from the main character and how they react to those going through a similar fate.",

Despite that, I was more than willing to try it out cuz P5 is THAT good (already played that game on PS4).\n\nMuch to my pleasant surprise, the story is obviously a continuation of the events of P5 and I love that! I'm always down to get more of the amazing characters. And this game introduces some new and awesome characters too!\n\nThe combat also surprisingly works REALLY well! The hack and slach feels satisfying and the mob density in some fights is really good!\n\nA quick note - Don't forget to save MANUALLY. Its been a while since I played P5 and I totally forgot I have to save manually lol. Don't think this game has auto saves at all. So, keep saving! I lost like 3-4 hours of progress cuz I was gaming late at night and forgot to save before I hit the sack.\n\nOverall a easy 8/10 for neutrals.. and a 9/10 if you are a Persona fan (like me)!",

In fact, if I had to complain it's almost too similar to P5. This is true for gameplay, atmosphere, and even story--it hits many of the same beats, including a couple of the more tiresome ones. It does a great job expanding upon a few of the characters, most notably Haru and Makoto, while also introducing an excellent newcomer in the form of Zenkichi.\n\nSome characters don't get much spotlight, unfortunately, like Ryuji and Mona, and I lament that the development of this game coincided with that of P5 Royal, so none of the excellent additions therein with Kasumi, Akechi, and Maruki are present. And though I really liked the presentation of the Persona roadtrip, less is ultimately developed by this story than I would have liked. It goes places, but in a self-contained way, sort of like some anime movies. Still, it's a solid experience, and if you enjoyed base P5, you'd probably be missing out if you skipped this",

        "content": "An enjoyable sequel to Persona 5. You REALLY should play through the original/royal before diving into this one as its a follow on from the main storyline of that game. That said it does NOT follow on from Royal's extra 3rd semester content so if you have gotten to the 3rd semester that does not apply here as this game was made at the same time as Royal. Albeit as of the time of making this review neither the original or Royal have been ported to PC yet so you will have to wait if you are PC only and pray that Atlus does port it after the success from Persona 4 golden's port. Personally i played through both on PS4 (Combined total hours of over 230 for Persona 5 and Royal, Yes i love that game so much i played through it twice despite its monstrous length).  Took me a little bit of time (about half way through the first jail)  to fully get used to the Musou style of gameplay as this is my first game of that type of playstyle but once i got into it its great stuff, The mixture of persona and that style of gameplay blends well in my opinion. Storyline is good for the most part (some parts may feel a little bit lacking but its still a good game) and there's a mixture of sizes for the jails. 4 are Longer more fleshed out ones while the other 4 are shorter and in some cases much shorter mostly for some storyline purposes. Kyoto's jail makes up for its length with a great ending boss fight though its a shame you can't refight it like the others. While some of the shorter jails are a little disappointing length wise this did not hinder my overall enjoyment of the game and its nice to have a persona game that isn't so insanely long. Albeit this game still has good length and it did take me some time to finish all the requests and main story etc and post game content as i like to take my time with games. Music as usual when it comes to persona games is fantastic and the game looks decent in a higher resolution.  In summary if you enjoyed the original Persona 5/Royal and can adjust to the Musou style over the usual turn based combat this is more goodness for you with the gang you have come to love.",

Not a lot should surprise you here.\nIMO a much better sequel than the other games I think of as Persona sequels.  Speaking of Persona 3 FES and Persona 4 Aerna.\n\nIts kind of silly, but I really enjoyed the character poses after the all out attack.  I might have done a few similar hand gestures or arm movements while playing the game.",

I.E. you can set controls for when you are in battle, but if you want to use that same button in the \"normal world\" you CANT. The game will unmap the button from when you are fighting.\n\nThis practically forces you to use the default keybindings, which suck so much that the game is borderline unplayable.\n\n\n\n[b]The music[/b]\nWhat for me was a BIG reason why i finished P5R was the incredible music. Sure there were a few bad songs, think about mementos and okumura's palace, but mostly, the OST was great! Now in P5S the difference between good songs and bad songs is amplified. There are a few absolute bangers like daredevil, the intro, and the remix of last surprise. But sadly, at least three of the songs that i had really wished that would've been gone remain. (Tension, Blood of Villain, High Pressure (seriously, fuck this song))\n\nOverall for the music, 8/10. Some songs are bangers, some i wish they would've replaced.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAs WarOwl would say, [i]it doesn't wooooork[/i]. From the boss fights with dialogue that you CANNOT focus on because the battles are now in real time instead of turn based which WILL make you miss story, to you being able to fully heal with no penalty whatsoever just by returning to the overworld and going back and the general clunky controls of some of your abilities... yeah, it doesn't work.\n\nClunky controls and poor game design choices. Yikes.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nYes i realize that i've barely played the game and that i'm nowhere near finishing it, but from what i'm seeing right now, this is not good. Unengaging, boring and plot-hole filled storytelling that does not address any of what happened during P5/P5R. Not for me.\n\nIt's short enough that you should just read it.\nPlease do tell me if the story gets better after the first palace, cause if it doesn't i don't think i'll finish the game.\n\n\nI'll definitely keep listening to some songs in the OST, and i love the opening, but i just can't see myself finishing this game any time soon.",

        "content": "My current favorite game of 2021. It's more than just a spin-off of Persona 5, it's also a great sequel and has my favorite soundtrack and gameplay mechanics out of the Persona 5 games. Definitely a more intense and action-packed game but it still allows you to take your time and plan out your every move. The combat is a perfect balance between a hack-and-slash game and a turn based RPG, it has all the same strategy of Persona 5 and more. It's not too difficult and it is still a good game for people who are new to the series.",

ARPG esk Dynasty warriors combat system with the persona system was one hell of a unexpected combination that works on a meta level. hope to see a P4 spin off using the their new hybrid engine for combat. considering P3, 4, 5 take place in the same universe, seeing a spin off like strikers would be gold imo. \n\nmy only issue is what they did to NG+ and Extreme(merciless) mode. \n\nDon't read this next part(spoilers)\n\n[spoiler] after beating another false god, NG+ is not unlocked like most other persona games, instead you are thrown into \"post game\" and given a boss rush set of requests with harder nightmare versions before you can face The Reaper, why is this bad you might ask? because in all persona games that feature him, he is a end game optional boss encounter that tends to be the hardest out of all before him, the Reaper does not screw around and forcing players to try and fight him to unlock NG+ is kinda harsh. if you struggle with dire shadows, you wont survive a minute with Reaper, ive been able to beat almost all the Dire shadows as well as prepping a fist full of high tier persona's to take on the Reaper. ive beaten him in every persona game so far, not gonna let him stop me from NG+ but for some people? they will most likely quit. defeating Reaper is also required for merciless mode(extreme) [/spoiler]",

With the best parts from both series, some of which was changed to flow better with the other, the gameplay is excellent. Things to be wary of. Although it seems as if the story is just Persona 5 again, it isn't. Although it does tread over similar ground, the wholly unique aspects and new characters like Zenkichi make up for it. Also, on PC there's a slight chance of infinite load times. That being said however, I personally only encountered it once, so as long as you save frequently (mainly before major events) it isn't a hassle.",

By itself the combos are not many, but they are well crafted enough to make it fluid and impactful.\n\nI did not present any issues from my end and I can definetly suggest this game as it has a great story with characters well developed, great gameplay, amazing music, the game is not short and enjoyable.\n\nAdditional note: I am glad to see Atlus bringing their games to PC and giving the PC community some love, I can't wait to see what they have prepared for us in the future",

        "content": "As someone who has played through Persona 5 Royal, I definitely love how they managed to turn a game that was once a JRPG into a Hack and Slash. The combat felt very satisfying and the story was overall fantastic, even the music was phenomenal. It was indeed a perfect execution of using a new genre for the series. The Persona series never seems to disappoint and I'm glad to enjoy the ride of this series. My verdict of this game will be a solid 9/10. The reasoning for the 9 is just because as much as this game is fantastic, I could definitely see some potential of including DLC like having Akechi or Kasumi as DLC Characters or maybe challenge packs like they did with protagonist of 3 and 4 that was seen in Royal where you can fight them and maybe gain their fusions to make their Personas. But besides that I recommend trying this game at some point if you have no other games to play.",

        "content": "So as a fan of persona 5 I just had to buy strikers and I wanted to do a review for other people who game to this game because of persona 5. I do a pros and cons type of review so I can make it as simple as possible. Now onto the pros\n\n[Pros]\n\n- [Combat]\nI love this games feel for the hack and slash type of game style they did not miss on the feel of combat and the enjoyment of constantly throwing out attacks and dodging.\n\n- [Bond] In the previous persona 5 it was done through spending time with characters and unlocking better skills, In this game it is gained through requests and story progression and is very neat upgrading the exact skills you want to.\n\n- [Personas]\nThey kept a lot of the old personas making it pretty fun seeing the old ones and knowing how to counter them off of memory from the previous game. I also like how in combat you can use the ability's as a combo that doesn't consume SP making the personas more involved since they branched more into melee combat it kept the feel of needing personas relevant.\n\n- [Requests]\nI seen a request and it allowed me to re fight a boss of a jail for a reward which was pretty dope not having to start a new game plus just to fight a certain boss again, which in turn gives the game more replay value without having to new game plus it.\n\n- [Fast Paced Combat] \nI enjoy running around and just slashing at every enemy in sight it makes for a more involved experience so you don't fall asleep while grinding levels as fast.\n\n- [Sequel]\nUnlike jumping from character to character when making a new game they instead made it like a sequel which was promising since I never played the other personas I wanted to relive the feel of the OG phantom thieves in persona 5. Making me want it all the more and I mention this because I have a con later down in the list making this make more sense to the rating.\n\n- [Art Style]\nIt's very unique in the environment inside the metaverse which I can appreciate a very lot since it makes it stand out from other games it makes you wanna keep playing the franchise.\n\nThis is my temporary review since I haven't fully played through and only have 10 hours into the game now onto the cons.\n\n[Cons]\n\n- [Sequel]\nSo far into my gameplay I haven't experienced much freedom which may be because I'm not far enough into the game, I really enjoyed the dating whoever you wanted or deciding what to do with your time. It strayed from the feel of persona 5 which makes this sequel a bit of a disappointment though this is a temporary review so this might change as I get further into the game and comments are enabled so if anyone wants to comment on this explaining how the freedom works I would appreciate that. I very rarely get time to play so it may be awhile till I get to see how it is.\n\n- [EXP] \nI fight almost every single enemy I find and I am still not a high level to where I can go through the area like its on very easy difficulty and that is not very promising for a time limited game time.\n\n- [Time Management]\nThe previous persona made entering and exiting the palaces and mementos much more problematic in this game they don't really worry you since you can go in and out as you please and your days won't end. It completely heals you and your sp is returned making it a lot less fun trying to survive on no hp or sp or even being tactical on how you use your sp/items.\n\nI do think this game will open up a lot of pros as I progress and this one specifically might just start slow but I will be back to update this review as I learn more things about the game.\nAnd this is the end of the review to all the people that stayed and read my review thank you and I hope you have a great day/night :3",

        "content": "It was a lot of fun getting the Phantom Thieves back together in this game. Wasn't expecting a full on sequel, but that's exactly what it is and it's a fantastic one at that. The combat was actually more fun than I thought it would be compared to Persona 5, which really helped make it feel fresher. The story was interesting and the new characters fit in perfectly. \nThe only issue I had with the game was some slight screen tear on cutscenes, but could just be due to my monitor more than anything. \nIf you enjoyed Persona 5 and want something fresh to keep playing, definitely give this a try.",

        "content": "Ware wa nanji\u2026 nanji wa ware\u2026\n\nFirst thing you must know is that the game continues the story of Persona 5 not Royal. No characters,events or ending are mentioned or seen in Strikers from Royal. Bare that in mind. It is a must to know the lore of Persona 5. Either play it or watch a no commentary walkthrough. Anime is not recommended as many things are lost.\n\nStrikers had a drastic change in gameplay from Turn base combat to Hack and Slash which made the game more fast paced and gives you a big window of how you will fight with shadows. As we might remember, Yakuza Like a Dragon also changed it's combat but to Turn Based which was not the best decision.\n\nNow we roam all around Japan to find Jails (Yes, now castles are called jails and they are not a little location but a whole city) and defeat Monarchs that rule them. There is no Memento for obvious reasons. \n\nThe game became very easy in comparison to the previous game. You are not limited with time anymore and can infiltrate jails as many times as you want. You don't need to raise your confidants anymore because there is a new system of Bond. You receive Bond Skill exp for battles,requests,bosses and so. You get points with each level that you can spend on skills that will help you in different ways. The shop is now a;ways in the hideout. One click and you can buy anything you want. You don't need to annoy poor Iwai for equipment or go to Takemi for meds. Ah, you will be hearing \"How many?\" and \"Are you sure?\" a looooooooooot of times, so be prepared. I warned you.\n\nThe story is as always good but there is one moment in the game which makes me question why the devs repeated themselves...\n\nBosses. If you played or watched Persona 5, you do remember that each boss was unique and you had to follow some strategy not to die. Sadly, bosses here are like regular enemies. Nothing special about them. No difficult stategy needed. You just need to mash the buttons and evade. Only the final boss was unique and had something different in the boss fight. \nI'll just give an example of Persona 5 boss. Madarame. Several phases. Painting and then fight with clones where you had to use correct skills to win. Here...just mash the down buttons. Maybe it was made so the game doesn't loose the pace and stays fast like all of the gameplay but these are bosses. When you beat them, you need to get the feeling that you won by doing something and getting the feeling that all the hours you spent to grind for a new persona wasn't just a woosh. \n\nIn general I like the game and it's new combat system. New locations were a nice change of pace and I hope the next game will have something more. Bosses need more attention because this is just a meh. I hope that the new game will have another cool story that I and other Persona fans will enjoy.",

        "content": "I should start this review saying that if you're new to the Persona universe, DO NOT PLAY THIS FIRST. This game is a sequel to the original Persona 5. This game fully assumes that you've played at least the original Persona 5, and doesn't give any background to new players, so play either the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first. I don't care if you have to watch an LP.\n\nAs a huge Persona 5 fan, I preordered this game and completed the story 4 days after it came out, playing nothing but this game. While it is significantly shorter than the original Persona 5, I can say that the combat is some of the most fun I've *ever* had in a game. You can totally feel the passion from this game, and the developers put their heart and soul into making something that will stay true to the Persona 5 vibe and the charm that made people fans of the game to begin with. \n\nNot even mentioning the SOUNDTRACK. This absolute banger of a soundtrack paired with super-intense-stimulus-overloading fights makes for some of the most fun you'll ever have in a hack n' slash game. Of course there are pretty easy to point out flaws with it like the story not being as long or good as the original, but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad for this game. If you loved P5, you will absolutely love this game.",

        "content": "It's just as flashy and horny for style as the original Persona 5 is, if not more so. \nWhile not a turn based combat system like the other games in the series, I still found the hack and slash mowing down of enemies to be quite enjoyable. It also adds to the character of quite a few main characters, which is nice because some of them were sorely lacking in the first Persona 5. \nWith that being said, it's incredibly similar to the first story and I found the final boss to be incredibly underwhelming, both in concept and as an actual fight.  Along with this, the story takes place over the course of a month, but don't let that fool you, there's still a lot of playtime to be had from the game. \nIt lacks a lot of the key elements of the series, like the turn based combat, social links, and time management, so don't go into the game expecting that. It does offer a few unique things to better fit with the style of game, but if you're expecting another Persona 5 Royal, you will be disappointed. \nNot the best game in the franchise, but it's still incredibly enjoyable nonetheless.",

        "content": "great game with a great post game as well which is unusual for any persona game. its basically a warriors game with persona elements which is a lot of fun with the combat forcing you to either pick a general use persona or a persona that has a specific element that can counter the shadows you fight. it should be mentioned that you can control your team members and a lot of times they can handle the fight themselves since they all have excellent movesets.\n\nbiggest problem i have with this game is the persona fusion system. the persona fusion was way more in depth in the normal games than compared to this one as a majority of fusions are dependent on the level of the persona and really the arcana (especially in late game). its pretty annoying to grind PP to level up your late game persona. (I am aware that there methods to circumvent this but still the requirement on levels is annoying).\n\ntl:dr good game ryuji says fuck",

        "content": "[u]Persona 5 Strikers is the best game I have played in 2021. [/u]\n\nHowever, its existence on PC is a harder sell as the game's story is a continuation from the PS3/PS4  game Persona 5. Yes, you can just pick up and play Strikers, but unless you watched the anime, or played the prior game you won't know the characters, their backstory and all of their character nuances and personality traits.\n\n[b]So what is the game?[/b]\n\nIt's a story driven action game with RPG elements. As you play the game you're tasked with infiltrating 'Prisons'. You fight your way through until you defeat the boss at the end. As you progress you collect Personas. Think of these like Pokemon. Each Persona has different skills and abilities. Some heal, some buff or debuff and some do fire, wind or death magic. You level up your characters and persona to increase their power and learn new abilities.\n\n[b]The Good.[/b]\n\n[u]The voice acting. [/u]\n\nThe game isn't 'fully' voice acted. Some sections simply have to be read, however similar to the game this is based on, large sections of the game are fully voice acted and the quality of the voice acting really elevates the game. All of the voice actors from Persona 5 have reprised their roles, with the addition of Nolan North joining the cast as the detective Zenkichi.\n\n[u]The combat. [/u]\n\nThis isn't your typical musou game. Rarely is the screen filled to the brim with enemies. Instead, as you traverse the area, you will see enemies roaming around. You can choose to avoid them or 'ambush' them for a tactical advantage. Combat then starts with a small group of enemies to defeat. The combat is fast and satisfying, blending in a range of melee combos, ranged weapon attacks and abilities (think spells). Enemies often have weaknesses that can be exploited, leading to the opportunity to deal massive damage.\n\n[u]Music.[/u]\n\nThis is obviously a personal preference. I like the Persona 5 music a lot. The Striker's soundtrack builds upon the existing soundtrack making slight changes, such as heavier guitar riffs.  The only glaring example here is the first 'prison' stage. The music is a stark contrast to the rest of the game. It's akin to something you might hear on a pachinko or slot machine. It's loud, noisy and is particularly grating on the ears. \n\nMy personal preference is to use the DLC which allows you to use combat music from all of the previous Persona games. As a fan of the Persona series, I'll always choose to engage in combat with Mass Destruction playing.\n\n[b]The Ok.[/b]\n\n[u]Story.[/u]\n\nThe story of the game is in a weird place. Persona 5 Strikers is the story sequel to Persona 5, but not Persona 5 Royal. That means that none of the events of P5R have taken place. Not game breaking, but something to consider. The story itself is fine, if not a little predictable. It's welcome that the characters continue to develop past the P5 story. Hearing Haru refer to herself as 'Beauty Thief' again was welcome.\n\n[u]Fighting when?[/u]\n\nPersona 5 has a lot of story. Some of it is voice acted but a majority of it is reading conversations between The Phantom Thieves. Sometimes you just want to get back into the action, but you'll need to wade through the story elements first. I personally liked the story, but some people might not expect this much from a fighting game. Be warned.\n\n[b]The Ugly.[/b]\n\n[u]Eternal Bonds.[/u]\n\nMy only real criticism of the game came from my desire to 100% it. In particular, one Achievement stands out as egregious, and that is \"Eternal Bonds'. To get this achievement, you need to raise your Bond level in game to 99. Raising your bond level happens as you play the game. Major story events, killing rare bounties and defeating bosses will all net you some bond level. However, I completed the game around the 48 hour mark. I then started new game plus and played through it again. Even after two complete playthroughs, I still didn't have enough. \nI grinded one particular rare bounty for about 10 more hours. In hindsight, I could have played NG+ on the hardest difficulty, but I did so up until completing Alice's Palace, but the progress on the bond levels didn't seem any faster.\nSo there's a reason only ~3% of all players have completed all of the Achievements. It's due to Eternal Bonds. If you plan on grinding bond levels, be prepared to do a lot of this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W0x5VNsTkQ \n\nIn the end, I did 100% Persona 5 Strikers. It's one of the few games I've sought to do so with. I still maintain it's the best game I have played all year and I do recommend it.",

The game's fighting mechanics are really fun, and each of the playable characters have fun movesets. New features such as leveling up Personas using Persona Points feel right at home for the series. Plus, for the first time in Persona history, the game can actually be difficult. Hard mode is ACTUALLY hard! It almost feels like a real Shin Megami Tensei game in terms of difficulty. In terms of story, this works very well as a sequel to the original Persona 5. All of the characters are enjoyable (except for Morgana, rot in hell you little shit) and feel like they're the same characters that I got to know so well in the original. The new characters such as Sophia and Zenkichi are phenomenal additions to the cast. The only problem in terms of characters is that there's no Goro Akechi or Sumi Yoshizawa, but that makes sense. Atlus, just please include those two as DLC. All in all, I love this game, and I hope Atlus continues to add more to it!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers, while not like other games in the series, is still an incredible game in my eyes.\nSPOILERS BELOW\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIn terms of gameplay, Strikers is akin to Hyrule Warriors, with the aspects of Persona gameplay mixed in. There are 4 difficulties; easy, normal, hard, and merciless, which is only available in NG+. Personally, I played on hard mode up until the Osaka jail, because by then, it took me around 30 minutes or so to clear out certain prison keeps. Normal is a good difficulty for people who are possibly new to the action format (such as myself) and I have not tried easy, but given that its easier than normal, its most likely forgiving. The aspects of normal Persona mixed with action style gameplay is interesting, but in my experience, it is very rinse and repeat. Honestly, I couldn't do too many of the special moves or master arts, because enemies always hit me down before I could finish them. It was much easier to charge Joker's gun, or just spam whatever the enemy was weak to. As for the requests and jails, it's a mixed bag for me. The requests are decent, and dont take much time to complete, but that's about it. The jails are interesting, but unlike Persona 5, they don't offer many hiding spaces for ambushes, causing you to have to either be ambushed, shoot an enemy from far away, or attempt a direct hit. However, they are more action packed in my opinion. Using the environment to do phantom dash attacks are quite nice and can create cool combos if you can use them correctly. All in all, the gameplay isn't bad, but it isn't spectacular either. My biggest complaints are that A. you can only see the telegraph for an enemy's attack if you are facing them, and B. you MUST be locked on if you want to quickly use a magic attack and keep the flow of your fight. I would, however, definitely play this over almost any triple A game made today.\n\nAs for the story, it essentially follows that of Persona 5. As a direct sequel (or spinoff? Royal makes things weird.), it takes place after the collapse of the Metaverse and after the Antisocial Force's semi-disbandment. Personally, I think that Strikers has a few loopholes that I won't go too deep into, but it does have some \"aha\" moments, but also some poorly instigated moments that just feel like a plot device. The story is still alluring, and I was invested the whole time, but some parts could have been a little fleshed out. The interactions between the Thieves were nice, however, which is one of the main things I like in Persona games.\n\nThe last part I'll probably talk about is formatting, graphics, ect. Frame cap is 60 fps which isnt the end of the world, but I did notice that Yusuke's showtime did lag out my computer occasionally, and sometimes when the camera pans out to a birds eye view or a showcase of the palace, there were glitched out portions of the screen, but that wasn't anything too bad. Nothing compared to the infinite loading screen I got on my rematch of the final boss :( But regardless, the game looks nice, obviously similar to that of the original Persona 5. The menus are nice, and the game has a lot of color.\n\nAll in all, I would still say this game is one of if not my favorite games on Steam, and for good reason. Every game has its flaws, but the world of Persona will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nPlus the music, too. Just buy the bonus content and listen to Counterstrike forever. Songs a banger.",

        "content": "I went into this game thinking I was going to play a Warriors game. What i got was a Persona game masked as Warriors game.\n\nI love the Persona series, but it works way better in turn based combat than in this basically real time madness where enemies are many and their skills even more. I also love Warriors games but here I can't get that almost immortal superhero 1 vs 1000 feeling as I have to dodge around and make fights as easy as possible with ambush tactics. Until the game throws me a boss or a mini boss with multiple times the difficulty I've had for the last 2 hours or so.\n\nI really wanted to like this game as it combines two of my favourites, but I can't really enjoy either side of it as is. It might be because of my expectations: I wanted more Warriors less Persona. I wanted to check my brain out and play hack 'n' slash game, but what I got was more of JRPG game with clunky gameplay.\n\nIf you enjoy the game, good for you. But I got more frustration than enjoyment and I would not recommend the game at this time. Maybe when I go back to the game at some point and just lower the difficulty to easy I can get something from it. At this moment, I just want to enjoy my evening and not get angry at a boss fight.",

The combat takes some getting used to as its not turn based like other persona games but its really fun once you get the hang of it. I also think its best if you play P5 or P5R before playing this game to get the best experience story wise.\n\nEdit -Play with controller. It will make your life alot easier :D",

        "content": "[h1] Well first things First, [/h1]\n\n You need to beat or watch (a play-through I heard the anime isn't too hot) Persona 5 to get some real enjoyment out of this game but you don't necessarily need to do the same with Persona 5 Royal. From what I played, there's no real spoilers from Royal I think but there could be secrets that I don't know about.  So playing royal isn't necessary but probably gives some extra flavor with some interactions more than likely. \nNow you might be asking yourself\n\n [i] Why do I need to play or watch Persona 5? [/i]\n\n well my good sir, ma'am or whatever pronouns align yourself with, this game is essentially more Persona 5 with a side of dynasty warriors game-play instead of that classic turn-base Persona Flavor. [b] If you haven't played or watched Persona 5 this game will not be that entertaining for you! You'll be buying a game that's basically an extra chapter to the Persona 5 story. If you have done so then the bold section does not pertain to you. [/b] Continuing on, You're not about to get all of the social simulator mechanics that Persona is known for but you'll be getting the aesthetic, music, and main cast interactions from it. If you want more of that this game is for you as this game is filled to the brim with fan-service but not the NSFW variety SO BACK TO TWITTER YOU GO YOU FIENDS, but I'll be joining y'all later.\n\nNow the for the main game-play...\n\nIts not for everyone.\n\nThe Dynasty Warriors formula is not the most responsive game-play of the bunch. At times you'll swatting away at a boss with long health bars for minutes on end. Luckily, they spiced things up by adding some SMT (Shin Megami Tensei a.k.a the series Persona derives from) mechanics which allows you to exploit the bosses weakness to beat them but that also go both ways. If you choose the wrong party for a fight some of your party members will get erased from the surface of the earth but if you already played Persona you'll be used to it. You can still customize your party to whatever play-style that suits you so if you want your Ryuji to be a physical Damage Chad you can do so. In particular with the game-play, I don't like the dodge function in this game, it took me while to understand it but I feel they could done of a better job at implementing it so you can dodge attacks more properly. Despite this though, defeating massive waves of shadows can be therapeutic but as I mentioned its just not for everyone.\n\nUltimately I think you should watch some game-play for a final verdict, Seeing is better than reading and if you see what I'm talking about you might be hooked or save some money in your bank account. If you're missing some Persona though this game is absolute must-buy specially if it get on sale for a better price.\n\nP.S\n\nWith the PC version the game was buggy in the past but since then I believe they patched \n certain things up so if you see any reviews about it being buggy make sure you check the date as the game could of been patched since then or there still could be issues with it. My experience wasn't too bad, I do admit to have issues in the beginning when the game first came out but after a month everything was smooth sailing to the end.",

        "content": "All the new songs and remixes of the old ones are insane, just like the in the other persona game(at least p3+), especially the new track Daredevil.\n\nThe gameplay is on the same level as original persona 5. i really recommend doing your first playthrough on normal and then play it on merciless new game plus, enemies scale with your level there, so its the difficulty where you actually experience the combat.\n\nFor optimization, its nearly perfect, i ran it on Radeon HD7800 series(gpu from like 2013 that is also in ps4) and i was getting 60 fps 95% of the time. If you have some stronger gpu put the resolution on 4k because the game either has dogshit or no antialiasing at all.\n\nStory. Its a persona game, Also play the original Persona 5 before this, because its gonna spoil a shit ton for you, and you also wont know who is who and why is what happening.\n\nOnly thing i kind of didnt like about it, is the forced \"Fuse by Result\" fusion option from other games, and that to fuse some higher level personas you had to level some level 15 persona to 65, good you can boost them with ingame money(which is the only actual way to level them up because the xp they are getting is miserable).\n\nOverall i rate this game 10/10 a perfect sequel, i dont regret spending 60 euro on this.\n\n\ntips:  If you get stuck on the first bicorn miniboss because he oneshots you, its ok, just try killing him until you do it, and then you can continue enjoying the rest of the game. The goat is busted as fuck, he \u00eds like 2 times harder than any other miniboss, or maybe even as hard as an actual boss.\n        If you bought the old songs dlc, go to settings>game settings and scroll until you see what soundtrack you want to listen to. Select random. If you dont like some of the songs in there, you can turn them off.\n        After you defeat the final boss and watch the credits, your save will say the game is completed, but it really isnt. Load it, and you will get called to the velvet room where lavenza tells you to kill all the bosses again, and when you kill them, you will get a request for killing The Reaper, if you do that, you will get an achievement, and will be able to play ng++\n       You will transfer everything, except for some story items to new game plus, including your level money and compendium, so if you finish the first playthrough at level 80, you will get level 90 and fuse lucifer in no time.",

The story feels like a wonderful continuation of what the original Persona 5 had to offer, and its unique combat style as an installment of a series of turn-based JRPGs gives players a fresh way to enjoy the Phantom Thieves as they jump back into action stealing hearts all over Japan. Everything this game offers, from the opportunity to experience characters I know and love once again to the absolutely amazing soundtrack fitting of the Persona 5 atmosphere, has me completely satisfied. I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who enjoyed Persona 5 and wishes to see the characters developed further (especially Haru).",

        "content": "P5S is a great game, and even though it's technically a spinoff, it feels like an extremely organic sequel to Persona 5 with a different combat system. Highly recommended it to players who enjoyed P5's characters and themes. If you liked P5 for only the turn based combat and didn't appreciate the characters, P5S is not for you \n\nIf you're looking to get into Persona, this is not the right game as it's a sequel through and through. Persona 4 Golden is a much better option,\n\nI found the gameplay to be rather enjoyable and thought it had a surprising amount of depth. The hack & slash setting and Persona based combat blended together rather well. There is however, no real social sim aspect and there is no confidant system. That being said, the character development for almost every character is really impressive. The new characters are also very well done. As usual, the OST is an absolute banger.\n\nCombat can get repetitive, and there are a few quality of life changes (accepting requests outside of the RV for instance) that would really help the experience. Persona fusion is also drastically simplified. There are only roughly 60 personas and fusing some of the last few takes a lot of grinding.\n\nOverall, if you liked P5 and are ok with a new combat system, this is a must have. If you're new to Persona and want to play on PC, start with P4G.",

        "content": "Despite its flaws, honestly a pretty good sequel/spin-off to Persona 5. Probably one of the best spin-offs we'll get of a persona game, it's just pretty solid all around.\n\nThe cast of characters from the original game are just as enjoyable as they were before, and I really like the new additions of Zenkichi and Sophia, they're pretty great as well. Especially Zenkichi, he's probably one of my favourite Persona characters now. \n\nMusic is amazing as usual in this franchise, all of the battle themes are bangers, even the music in some of the cities are really great to listen to as well. \n\nGameplay is where I think I had a few problems with, as well as the story. The combat whilst being fun at times, I felt like could of been improved slightly or perhaps just not as repetitive as it was. Whilst I liked the action combat this time around instead of the turn based system in the original game, the novelty of it got old quick for me at least, and I didn't really enjoy it towards the later parts of the game. It's not bad, I just think it could be improved slightly (even if I'm not really sure how? I felt like sometimes the combat was just spammable sometimes with certain moves, or doing different combos weren't really rewarding). I still think how they implemented Personas in the combat was still pretty well executed though, but perhaps could of reduced some of the SP drain, as I felt that sometimes was pretty hard to manage at times. \n\nThe jail designs were pretty cool, but most of the time, I didn't really think too much of them as level designs. They weren't bad or anything, just nothing really memorable. \n\nThe story, even though I enjoyed most of it, felt formulaic and VERY similar to the original's. It's not bad, but perhaps slightly unoriginal and predictable times. Still felt it was interesting to go through though, and was definitely better than what I was expecting. \n\nOverall, I personally really enjoyed P5S despite its flaws. Honestly a pretty good spinoff to Persona 5, and you HAVE to have played the original to enjoy the game in my opinion, as it'll spoil you quite a bit of what happened in the original, and you'll miss some of the references. If you didn't like the original Persona 5, then I can't really recommend this game to you. If you were a huge fan like me of the original however, DEFINITELY get this game, you'll probably really enjoy it.",

        "content": "After a lot of struggling, I decide not to recommend this game. It is hard to argue the game is totally terrible, but I spent 80+ hours on it.  However, I do want to point out some fatal issues with this game which lead to my decision. First, the plot is filled with cliche. The story is highly predictable and boring. Second, personas play an awkward role in the combating system: on the one hand, creating/upgrading personas is so complicated, but personas are not necessary for non-merciless fights. So, it seems that there is a complicated system of personas that you would feel that it must mean something, but it actually does not really make much change until you play the merciless mode. On the other hand, once you play the merciless mode, the fight is unnecessarily hard and tedious without the proper personas, yet, the right personas basically make fights as a cycle of releasing persona skills, refilling sp and releasing skills again. I found myself push the same 3-4 buttons in the same order for 5 minutes to complete a boss fight in the merciless mode, which is boring. The creator failed to strike a balance between non-merciless game and the merciless game as well as the fight with and without strong personas. As an action game, fighting is one of the most important elements, failing to deliver challenging yet enjoyable fights makes the greatest failure of this game.",

The Characters - old and new - are done wonderfully and work great with each other. The plot starts out interestingly and knows how to balance increasing tension with the relaxed feeling of a road trip through Japan. \n\nI have no experience with Musou/Dynasty Warrior games, but the gameplay is fun and snappy - a lot of switching between your party members during combos to utilize their strengths and weaknesses. It can get a little stale thou if you play longer sessions without a break. \n\nAlso... The game is immensly more stable than at launch. Meaning I encountered no more crashes. Some cutscenes still feel like they are a little lagging, but the game itself looks good and plays on a smooth framerate. \n\nIf you loved Persona 5 and want more of the characters then this game will make you happy.",

        "content": "A game that goes beyond its inspiration, and accomplishes something truly special.\n\nAs Strikers is a sequel to a game that isn't yet on PC, I feel obligated to say that there will be marginal spoilers for the original Persona 5 and Royal here, at least insofar as areas that I will be directly comparing to with Strikers.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Persona, and cited Persona 4 Golden as my #1 favorite game of all time until only a year or two ago. I love the focus on slice-of-life melodrama and cheese mixed with 'friendship is the true power!' anime goodness. The music is always god-tier, and the cast of characters are almost always endearing beyond easy comparison in the genre. \n\nTo say Persona 5 was a disappointment isn't exactly fair, but there were plenty of areas it fell short in, not just in relation to its predecessors, but entirely within its own goals, that I still talk about with my partner to this day. While its invention of an entire district called 'Shibuya' was no doubt innovative for the medium, spawning many spinoffs such as The World Ends With You or even a widespread effort in 1990's Tokyo to more closely mimic the buildings seen here, unfortunately that same inspiration couldn't be seen in the pacing and intricacies of its narrative. To go into greater detail here would be straying closer to writing a review of Persona 5 rather than Strikers, but I'll simply say that as the credits rolled on 5, I was filled with no great desire to ever see the Phantom Thieves again. \n\nThen Strikers came along and- I wish I could come up with a better phrase- stole my heart.\n\nStrikers' abandonment of the Social Link and time management systems that dominate the mainline Persona entries was publicized well beforehand, which caused me to be much more reticent about picking up the game. Would plot be taking a backseat? Would these already thin characters be reduced to little more than an aesthetic for Musou combat? \n\nIf those same worries assail you, please believe me when I say nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves flourish under a much sharper and much more tightly-written story here than in their own debut. While nothing deeply shellshocking for the genre, the plot has plenty of emotional gravitas, culminating not just in these pre-established heroes. but in practically every new addition to the cast. People act like human beings here, not 'shitty adults' or plot automatons. The core party has chemistry and plays off of each other brilliantly, and are even given actual time to enjoy themselves and more fully indulge their personalities beyond the most surface-level of jokes based on their eccentricities. \n\nThis story works in tandem with an absolutely phenomenal combat system. I've only had a very slim amount of experience with Musou games in the past, so I can't draw many comparisons, but I will say that simply getting through by button mashing is an impossibility. If you want to get through specific minibosses or even regular enemy encounters past the first few hours, you have to apply constant thought to your actions, thinking a few steps ahead, just like in JRPGs, while also honing your instincts and committing combos to muscle memory. It's an extraordinarily well-done fusion of genres that I very sincerely consider to rival the best in the business. Neither the turn-based roots nor the slasher reworks overshadow each other; instead, they compliment each other like sunlight illuminating a pane of stained glass, revealing how each individual facet constitutes a brilliant whole. \n\nI absolutely adore Strikers, and would argue it as better as most of the other games in its series, mainline, or spinoff. It understands its heroes' motivations better than the original game's writers, presents a beautifully innovative combat system, and strings along a truly magnificent score to lend each and every moment even greater impact. It's a masterwork of a title, and definitely the best game I've played so far this year.\n\nWell worth every last penny, and so many more.\n\nThese devs deserve a raise.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a wonderful continuation of the world of Persona 5. The characters maintain their growth and prove how memorable they are through dialogue, the story is a heartwarming romp across Japan, and the music keeps the funky flair mixed with newfound upbeat tempos and hard rock to hammer home the extremely hype show-stopping moments of the game. With a run time of 90-100 hours and then some for those who want even more, the price is well worth it if you are looking for a new action game to sink your free time into.\n\nHowever, the combination of classic Persona mechanics and action game speed, timing, and reflexes, along with some new innovations or streamlined bits, creates a super cool blend of worthwhile progression that is as addicting as it is semi-frustrating. You can only get better at the game by practicing your moments of striking while the iron is hot, but when ambushes effectively end encounters before they begin when the Phantom Thieves gain higher levels, sometimes there are points when you are just waiting to put your button skill and game knowledge to a real test. It is a minor grievance, but admittedly this was an issue on normal difficulty for me. I plan on trying out harder difficulties in the near future.\n\nOverall, this is a must have for Persona 5 fans, possibly Persona/Shin Megami Tensei fans in general who want an electrifying change of pace from the turn-based format that you're used to.",

        "content": "8.5/10 (9 if you are a Persona fan)\nPersona 5 Strikers is by definition, A Sequel to Persona 5 (not royal, as it does not seem to have references to that game story wise), and its a damn good one at that. Even though the game was not only using a completely different Fighting system, from Turn based to Warriors Hack and Slash like, AND was made by a different company, the game at large still feels and plays like a Persona game. What Koei Tecmo pulled off to recreate the Persona style is nothing but extraordinary. Many of their previous warriors games, in my opinion, were just plain boring. I am not a big fan of Warriors games, but somehow they made Persona 5 Strikers still feel not only like Persona, but an actual fun game (sorry Warriors fans). Now onto the pros and cons of this game.\n\nCombat: The combat in this game is simply amazing, especially for a combat system that I previously dislike. With the use of not only Personas and the Phantom Dash Mechanic making the combat feel unique and special each interaction, but also each character's unique playstyle and personality, while also staying true to who they are from the previous game. The game always tries to throw in a new gimmick or mechanic into the fight each time you progress in order to prevent the combat from becoming stale. Fighting large quantities imo is just plain satisfying, however fighting one, strong enemy can show the limits of the combat system. The game does try to spice it up with new mechanics, but it is obvious the combat was made for large groups, as slashing only one target doesn't feel as satisfying, and there were a couple of moments where I thought turn based would had made the boss fight more interesting.\n\nDifficulty: the game was simply easy, a bit too easy at times but at the same time, would be hard. It may be due to me doing all the requests in the game, but near the end it was very uncommon to die, as the game had many many, many forgivable mechanics in order to prevent death, while also many of the enemies would telegraph their attack, allowing for alot of time to react and dodge. There was a Merciless option too, but that was only after you beat the game + post-game content.\n\nStory:Im not going to dive deep into the story simply to avoid spoilers, but at large, the story was pretty damn good. Again, wasn't as good as mainline Persona games, but was still really good at the end and gave me the badass feel that the Persona 5 story previously gave me. The message of this game was also pretty good, tackling modern society issues, and having really complex characters, with none of them being just pure good or pure evil, but instead having reasons for their actions.\n\nCharacters: the Phantom Thieves has returned yet again, and I think they still were just as good as in the previous game. They even gave Haru much needed character development that persona 5 lacked in, while also making everyone else more fleshed out, while sticking to who they were in the first game. The New Characters were also amazing, as not only were the new main characters super fleshed out, but also the side characters and the antagonists were really amazing to watch and learn about. There wasn't really an amazing main antagonist like what persona 4 and kinda persona 5 had, but the story kinda went through the same story arc as persona 5 did, and tbh I was fine with it.\n\nMusic: as always, the Persona music is back and better then ever. The OST for this game consisted of mostly remixes of previous Persona 5 music, usually in a rock remix format. There was also brand new music for this game, and they were simply sooooooo goooooodddd. Idk how tf they produce bangers after bangers of music, but they do somehow. There was an issue for the ratio of new music and remix music, as I did feel like there was a bit too many remixes where they could had used a new song, but the remix were bangers anyways so I ain't complaining lol.\n\nSmall Nitpicks/Positives:\n-LOVED how this game felt like Persona 5: Sequel, with just a new combat system.\n-PC controls were awful, I had to remap a shit ton of buttons in order to make it playable. In the end I got it to work and made if playable, but there was still some issues I couldn't get rid of like how the camera was just either too damn fast, or too damn slow to rotate. I know the game was made for controllers, but whatever I am just that kind of guy.\n-The Voice mixing in this game was all around the place. Most of the time, it was pretty good. Sometimes however, the Voice actor would be too quiet, too loud or even have a drop in quality as if they didn't have any noise suppression. It was especially obvious during the beginning segments, like how sometimes even the character's audio would be so damn quiet I would have to repeat them, which just sucked. It was however pretty obvious it was due to the Voice actors having to record remotely due to Covid-19, so I think they get a pass in that regard.\n-from persona 5 to persona 5 strikers, due to the combat change, some things were nerfed or majorly buffed indirectly. The SP pool was still pretty small, that was just a 5 thing in the series and its back in strikers. However, items are just 10x better in this game due to not only having huge quantities to buy in the shop and around the city, but also due to now being able to pause the game and chug a shit ton of potions and food without the penalty of it taking a turn like what the previous persona games did. IMO I wasn't a big fan of this, as it did kinda slow down combat, but it was different due to the combat, and there wasn't much to do in that regard except maybe nerf the amount of items.\n-The game also had weird PC port things alongside it. Its obviously a console port of a game with things like 60 fps lock, game logic pauses when you don't focus on the window, till you go back into the game, and even with max details, the game seemed to have an anti-aliasing issue, with characters and further away objects just looking pretty pixelated imo.\n\nIn conclusion, the game was still really damn good, especially for a persona spinoff title. This is most def the best spinoff title from the entire persona series, but I still think the turn based combat should stick for the mainline series going down. Even though I really enjoyed this combat system, it did have its limitations, especially with large boss fights that the other system didn't lack. Of course large quantities was better in this system, but hey. Other than that, this game is especially worth to get if you played Persona 5, as this is just a continuation sequel to that game. If you are a first timer however the game is still really damn good, but you maybe lost in the story element and characters as you don't know who they are and what they did before, as they especially make tons of references to the previous game. I still think you can go thru this game w/o persona 5 experience, but I still highly recommend playing Persona 5 First. The length of the game took me around 50-55 hours, which also included me doing all the requests that was allowed in first playthrough, which is a really damn good length and so worth the price of the game (idk why people complained it was too explained like ok lol).\n\n8.5/10 (9 if you are a Persona fan), really damn good game.",

        "content": "Out of all the persona franchise games I've played, Strikers is probably my new favorite! Although honestly ever since P5 came out I've been in love with this persona installment. The story for Strikers was fun and I enjoyed watching the characters get to take a road trip together xD The mechanics for the game are very PC friendly since you can customize them pretty well. Just be warned that there is lots of button and mouse mashing ;-; The play style is also very different than what is characteristic for persona games which are typically turn based, but I actually really liked the style used in strikers, as it was more engaging and action packed. I will caution that the game covers some pretty heavy topics, but if you are a fellow persona or P5 lover this title is a must play.",

After watching a few streams of it my only gripes were the frequency of repeating voicelines in shops and some audio balancing issues in some in-engine cutscenes (the not extensively 3d-animated ones). Gameplay is great, story is good (albeit an obvious parallel to P5's story at times) and all in all, it is a very good sub-50 hour experience.",

This game play is different from the usual turned based combat that persona games have and I actually love the risk they took it payed off so much having to use personas mid fight is a really nice mix up. Bosses were really nice and challenging. But the final boss just didn't feel challenging. I think the boss should be buffed. Rest game was amazing the enemies weren't so challenging to make you want do pull your hair out. Overall was really fun to play. I might just replay the game cause it was so much fun.

        "content": "P5 strikers continues a few months after the end of Persona 5 with spoilers regarding many of the events of Persona 5. Strikers does not contain content from persona 5 (The) Royal such as new characters.\n\nPersona works like final fantasy in that each entry in the series is self contained but shares elements between all of them. Personas (The spirits/demons/manifestations you summon to help you fight) and other mechanics work similarly across the other games but the story can be understood and is grounded on an individual basis.\n \nPersona 5 in particular is inception meets anime and Persona 5 Strikers tosses the turn based combat system for a real time fighting game with a story centered on travel around Japan. Outside the dungeons you advance the story and prepare by obtaining items such as healing or buff single use items and equipment and accesories that affect stats and damage. In the dungeons you manage your energy to clear objectives advancing towards the goal of stopping people from hurting people, just like base game 5. \n\nYou have a nice full team with different fighting styles you can swap between but you're really gonna stick with the main character, Joker, due to having the most direct power progression and for him being the character who's perspective you'll experience most of the story from. As soon as the game gives you the chance I recommend just learning how everyone works. Exp sharing is on I think but people will still lag behind I think. You'll want everyone about the same power.\n\nPersona as a series knows how to use a great deal of subtlety, but it's main ideas it will remind you of often, and loudly. The great music being the best example (Im looking at you \"wake up, get up, get out there\" from 5!) The story is about many things but remember growth and understanding are at the center. It's very anime, trust the power of friendship. \n\nMy main enjoyment of the games' stories is that they help with introspection of ideas by having a wide range of approaches presented to you with many of their consequences and logical/emotional fallacies shown clearly.\n\nGameplay wise: Hit those weaknesses! Your auto combo does different stuff depending on which persona you have and each enemy has different weaknesses. Thanks to free abilities with certain persona combo attacks if you have the skill you could go entire boss fights not spending any energy- if you manage to survive that long and have the patience, otherwise press the persona button to pause the game and aim an ability. This uses SP which less items and abilities recuperate easily. Keep a wide variety of attacks available, fighting without hitting weaknesses gets expensive fast and every time you leave a dungeon to recuperate the enemies re-spawn.\n\nPersonal recommendation for a game mechanic I wish I knew about sooner, accumulated power: If you feel low power in the game fuse more personas towards your level cap. Don't be afraid if a persona becomes a lower level than the cap from a fusion, it will eventually get more stats the more you fuse the resulting persona. \nIf you do a newgame + run...check the guides.\nHaru best girl don't @ me.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a strong recommend for fans of Persona 5 (P5), but I don't think the game will be nearly as enjoyable for people who aren't familiar with P5's characters or the Persona franchise in general. The combat was surprisingly fun for me, as I don't really enjoy this particular genre of gameplay (previously played Dynasty Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors), but it isn't good enough if you don't know anything else about what is going on in the game. \n\nBut I am a fan of P5 and the Persona franchise, so I really enjoyed spending more time with these characters and meeting new ones. The story is good enough but I was craving a more personal connection between the plot and the heroes. The story was more intimate and impactful in P5. \n\nWhat I missed most from P5 was the time management and relationship building portion of the game, but this did make Strikers much easier to get through and it was a very focused experience. So while I would have liked to see more of this in a Persona game, I ultimately don't think it took much from the experience.\n\nSo an easy recommend from me, with the caveat that I think this game has a very specific audience.",

        "content": "Ahh, Persona 5 Strikers, I've been wanting to get my hands on you for awhile, and now that I have, I can finally write a review. Now, I highly recommend you at the very least watch a playthrough of the original Persona 5 (Or Persona 5 Royal) first before picking this game up, as it's a direct sequel to Persona 5. I won't be covering the story of Strikers much in this review either.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of Persona 5, you once again play as Joker, as you and the rest of the Phantom Thieves travel around Japan for the Summer. That's pretty much the premise.\n\nThe gameplay is very different from the mainline games, Persona 5 Strikers is a Hack and Slash with RPG elements. The gameplay itself I found quite fun, and I definitely found a few of the battles a bit challenging, even on normal difficulty. \n\nOne of my favorite parts gameplay-wise is that I never ever felt the need to grind for experience. I never felt too underleveled or too overleveled. The game also reintroduces Persona fusion. And while not as vast as the mainline games, it was still quite robust and intuitive. Dare i say, some aspects of the fusion I liked more compared to Persona 5. \n\nWithout getting into it, the story was really good, on-par with most persona games. I found myself invested in not only the characters i'm familiar with, but also the newly introduced ones. And there were a lot of moments that made me visibly happy, sad, angry, and so on. And that's a sign that they did something right.\n\nContent-wise, this game has quite a bit. It only took me roughly 40 hours to beat from start to finish over the course of four days, then again I played it practically nonstop when I bought it. I'm a bit of a Persona fanboy, haha. \n\nI do also plan on completing this game 100%, definitely. This game has quite a lot you can do in it, even in post-game you still got some stuff left.\n\nThe english voice acting was fantastic. I plan to play the game again in Japanese to compare, but I just LOVE the english voice cast so much, some of the deliveries were on point, and I laughed out loud quite a bit at many lines.\n\nOf course, I can't talk about a Persona game without addressing the best part about the series. The music.\n\nGood GOD the music. It's fantastic! The music is a LOT more fast paced compared to the mainline games. All the battle tracks get me absolutely hyped to fight. And the remixes of songs like Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert, among others, were done amazingly well! I could listen to each track for hours and NEVER get tired of it! \n\nI did yoink the deluxe edition though, which means I got two DLCs along with the base game! So I'll cover that next.\n\nThe first DLC was the all-out attack pack, it gives you a bunch of skill cards, along with 10,000 Persona points you can use to level personas up. The skills cards were nice, but also a bit unnecessary since the game is quite generous with it's skill cards, doesn't really justify the need for the price tag. \n\nThere's also the BGM DLC, it adds tracks from various persona mainline games. In my opinion, this is the better DLC option of the two. Changing the BGM can help change battles up a bit, and the fact that they remixed the battle theme from Revelations: Persona just for this game says a lot to me.\n\nThe Deluxe edition also came with bonus content on the side! Such as the soundtrack, a digital art book, and Behind-the-scenes footage! Which I find really cool! Watching the footage gives you a glimpse as to how much passion went into the game, and I enjoyed watching it!\n\nNow that all that's been said, let's get into the issues I had with this game, it's mainly bugs and small issues though.\n\nOne of the biggest things i experienced was audio issues, in-game audio was cutting in and out, along with crackling and stuttering. This is most apparent when I went to shop for things and bought things over and over in quick succession, or when I was in a menu like the compendium and scrolling down from the top to the bottom really quickly. This also happens in animated cutscenes, which kind of breaks the flow of everything, unfortunately. It never happened that often during normal gameplay, but it was often enough to the point that it ended up being really distracting, Although it was extremely rare, the game would also crash, which definitely was a bit frustrating when it did happen. A smaller thing was various instances of voiced dialogue not matching the text box, and lastly, audio balancing with the english voices. Sometimes the english voice acting is hard to understand, they sound too quiet, even had to turn the music down so i could hear the voice acting. This was mostly apparent with soft spoken voices. I'm not too mad at the audio balancing though, since they were recorded during a global pandemic, so that's something I can let go. That's pretty much it with my issues. \n\nAll in all, if you don't wanna deal with the audio issues and rare crashes, then I recommend getting the PS4 version, as it's probably the best version of the game. But if you don't mind the issues and want the convenience of having it on your PC, or you don't have a PS4 or Switch, then get this version, it's still worth it! The game is not only a fantastic one, but it's also a fairly stable port! I didn't ever have any problems with framerate either, which is a plus! This game receives a 9/10 from me!",

I have to say that THIS game is indeed a good change of pace. The hack and slash genre is repetetive but doesn't make you tired of it. However I must say that the game lacks some combos, but when you play enough hours you will learn how to chain some little things to make good damage. \nWell game overall and recommend it (wait for a discount because it's kinda expensive tho)",

        "content": "Is quite difficult to qualify this game, it\u00b4s been like 3 months (at the time of this review) since i finish for first time Persona 5 Royal and inclusive all games in the saga (only the mains). Since there i was thinking how, the way I did to get here and reflect, every day about the saga. And then i remember i have to finish one more game for finish this saga. And that game was Persona 5 Strikers.\n\nIn that moment i knew that P5S, wasn\u00b4t realy like is going to be masterpiece, but i was thinking that is going to be a good game and one to remember. so one week later after finish p5r, i buy this game and started to play the game.\n\nAnd two week later i taken out all the trophies, and i was feeling sad and odd. The structure of history was litterally like p5 (original game, not the royal), i feel like the game took all the things that i don\u00b4t like about p5 history and put again, but this time worse, but that didn't make me not cry at the end of the game, even so i feel like the game was missing something: the essence that the persona games have. and the very essence of p5, inclusive i doubt myself about all the persona games is masterpieces and then i reflect about this game, clearly for me p5s isn\u00b4t like a true persona game, even like p5/p5r sequel, but it\u00b4s have his moments, i cry and laugh, is still a good game and can be enjoy so much, like the gameplay or the soundtrack (Is quite impresive as always), but as a fan of the series and Atlus games, i personally don\u00b4t like too much this game.",

The characterization of the P5 cast feels very true to the characters I came to know well through my playthrough of Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. The new characters in the game are really good, too, and I really like the combo sets for both of them. The boss fights in the game that I've done are very good, and the combat feels very fluid and nice. (even though I still mostly just button mash and hope things go well.) Other than the combat, the story is handled well and feels like a natural continuation of the P5 story. Also, Yusuke is still best boi.",

They've managed to fit the feel of Persona combat into a completely different battle style and genre, as well as to a point the overworld investigation parts. The overworld parts being extremely bare, but that's understandable with how many different towns they implemented. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and the character interactions it made happen which are one of the big things about Persona.\n\nMy only complaint is one of the dungeons is so long, they make new Requests available mid dungeon without needing you to leave for any reason. It felt like a really long stretch of just doing combat things. It needed some kind of mid dungeon story break point but that's just me. And it's only the case for one dungeon, all the others feel well paced and well designed.",

        "content": "Pros:\n\nGood character interactions (imo better than P5 or P5R, none of that Morgana vs. Ryuji drama)\nGameplay is addictive as hell (no seriously, the base game is like 40-50 hrs but here I am doing playthrough after playthrough because I just can't put it down)\nKiller soundtrack (then again, it's P5, you probably know what to expect by now)\nMore screentime for characters that were somewhat neglected in P5 and P5R, such as Haru and Yusuke.\nMany characters to play and imo they all feel pretty distinct, useful, and pretty fun to play\n\nCons:\n\nWriting (plot) is kind of meh, especially near the end, but it's not terrible\nSometimes freezes during loading screens (I've heard people say the 5th dungeon specifically, but for me it happens all the time, even entering/leaving velvet room, using shops, location transitions, etc.), which can undo your progress if you haven't saved recently. That being said, SAVE OFTEN.\nSP/persona skills seem unbalanced, especially on Merciless mode; you have to use skills multiple times to break \"shields\" on bosses, let alone down them for an all out attack, but the amount of SP each character has is similar to P5/P5R, where this is not the case. Endgame often turns into a case of spamming persona attacks and SP items (the grind for SP items is real, especially since shops don't restock unless you do multiple battles in the metaverse)\nSome controls are a little wonky (such as all-out attack, phantom dash, follow-up attack, interact, etc. all being triggered by the same button, with limited ability to create separate hotkeys for them). This seems to be a symptom of poor porting from console.\n\nYMMV (i.e. some info that may be a pro or a con depending on the person):\n\nNo confidants/social links, no time management (you can leave and re-enter the dungeons at any time to replenish HP and SP with no detriment), no turn-based combat (i.e. missing many Persona gameplay staples)\nThis is a direct sequel to P5, NOT P5R (and the story very much reflects this)",

Never though I would say that as i'm usually pretty impatient.\n\nThat being said I still really liked this, and I took the time and watched all the cutscenes and dialog on youtube (all 16 hours of them). \n\nLong story short: I really like the story and the characters, just like persona 5. I enjoyed seeing the characters I had grown to love in the other game continue to grow and work together. But the gameplay felt somehow more boring and samey then rpg battles.

The game's telling me that \"A\" is \"B\" and \"X\" is \"Y\" and vice versa. \n\nThis will be confusing for the player to use, and I don't see anyone getting used to it. Some might say that that button placement is ideal for an XBox controller, but the button mappings are displayed for the Switch pro controllers as well, like the \"ZL\" and \"ZR\" buttons.\n\nYou should settle for a DualShock4 controller or an XBox One controller (and heck, even the keyboard and mouse).

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a very fun game. It takes what people loved about the characters and atmosphere of Persona 5 and made a sequel that was very enjoyable, but I will start with some problems I had. First off I can't really recommend this game to someone who hasn't experienced the story of Persona 5 in one way, shape, or form. The game does a good job of relating back to certain things in the plot for context, but you may not feel very connected if you don't know the content from before.  Secondly, the combat in the early game feels very repetitive, and not very satisfying. My friends who also played this game felt the same for some confirmation. You will need to start getting stronger and more versatile Personas before you start getting into the good stuff. This is an RPG so that's a given, so if you thought you could mash through the game it won't be that easy. Lastly, the story is kind of stale for the first chunk and feels like you're getting nowhere. Once the Phantom Thieves start piecing together the signs and make their way towards the bigger baddies, the story gets very good, very fast thankfully. This leads on to the good parts. The game looks fantastic on PC. The effects and landscapes pop with color and are a pleasure to look at. Also the mid-late game story is very good, along with the ending being very nice. An absolute plus is the post-game content. There are many requests you can do for stronger weapons and fighting harder version of previous bosses for a fun challenge. Though I had my issues I highly recommend this game to Persona fans, but give a smaller recommendation to new comers. Very fun, maybe wait for a price drop. 8/10",

        "content": "Both the best Warriors game, and least warriors game.\n\nPersona strikers is a sequel to the vanilla persona 5 that plays with the hack and slash combat of dynasty warriors.\nstory wise this doesn't have any plot points related to persona 5 royal.\n\nquick questions:\n\nWhich version should you buy:\nEither buy the game one PC or PS4, don't bother with the switch version. PC and PS4 are so similar it just comes down to your preference, on switch, the loading times are like waiting at your local dmv to retake your license photo while the old man is yelling at the girl behind the counter on why he can't show an ID to confirm his states residency so you just have ti sit there until he finally leaves so you can get your picture done and move with your afternoon.\nIts bad.\n\ndo you need the deluxe edition?\nNo. Unless you intend on doing multiple playthroughs and need variety in the music, there isn't any point to it. the all out attack pack gives you some resources that'll make the early game easier at the start. but after that, you'll be swimming in resources, so really your just paying 10 extra bucks for legacy music.\n\ndo you need to play any other games prior to starting this?\nNot unless you want to. Play persona 5 or watch the anime, you won't be super lost here. the game tells its own story that takes place a few months after the events of persona 5, though your not going to be drowned in call backs and references to the previous game. Its got a few places it takes itself for a persona game thats a fun ride, least to say, you'll be entertained if you're in the camp who just loves persona for its story\n\nHow difficult is the game?\nPlaying on normal mode, its fairly simple and wont beat you to your knees after the first couple hours. you might feel starved for resources at first, but after the first dungeon is done, you'll be fine. Worst case, if you fight tougher enemies without their weaknesses in your party, the fights will just last another 15-ish minutes.\nOnce you go into new game plus however, your characters will die in only a couple hits. Its doable, though a clear difference.\n\nhow long is the game?\ndoing a single playthrough on normal mode with doing every side quest, and most achievments, just over 50 hours. For completionist 86-95 hours since you will have to grind a small amount near the end.\nI 100% the game 86 hours and didn't feel like I was grinding at all until the last 3 hours. By far this was one of the most enjoyable games I've 100% as the pacing really doesn't struggle to keep itself together.\n\nNow for everything else:\nHow different is this game from normal dynasty warriors & persona?\nbesides throwing out turn based combat and the traditional calendar system, your able to freely come and go from the games dungeons as much as you want at no penalty to you.\nYou wont need to manage keeps and battle enemies in hordes and dictate who should target what, rather you have a set map you can be stealthy and fight enemies in with your 4 party members (who can be switched with the entire cast outside of battles ) will join the fight. killed a handful of enemies and move on. \"Keeps\" from dynasty warriors have been reduced to simply plot points on the map rather than a part of the map to take that you dont wanna lose.\nthere's a clear simplicity from the usual warriors spin off here and its all the better for it.\nPersona fusing is here again as you'll be getting sacrificing personas to keep yourself going.\nall the party members are useful this time around and you'll use them all fairly regularly through the main the main story.\n\nfinal verdict: 10/10\nTLDR: a solid hack and slash that doesn't feel like tedious, even into the games final moments of completion.",

        "content": "I started playing this game immediately after obtaining the Platinum Trophy for P5R on the PS4. It felt weird at first, after 190+ hours of turn based combat on P5R. However, once you get used to the changes, P5S is a true successor of P5R. This is a true sequel, maybe not so big as the original, but everything is here: all the Phantom Thieves, all the adventures, amazing music, top quality voice cast and loads of fun and things to do. I hope this game receives the Royal treatment in the future.\n\nSuggestion: Play P5R first before playing this game. There are a lot (and I mean a lot) of references to P5R that make you connect more with the plot if you know what they mean.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that Ann completely forgot about being my GF xD",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the Vanilla Persona 5 (PS3/PS4) game NOT Royal. With that being said, to enjoy the full experience of Strikers. The player must've played/experienced the Vanilla Persona 5, since there's a lot of inside jokes from that game. \n\nThis time around, Strikers is a Hack&Slash with some JRPG mechanics. Due note that there's no S-Links, no romance/dating options, and there's a lot of cutscenes. What makes Strikers unique from the other Warriors games is that it requires a lot more strategy. Meaning early game the player can't just spam magic attacks - which requires SP (Skill Points) to win every battle. Remember this is an Atlus game, they make their games difficult in the beginning to make sure the player understand the game's mechanics. \n\nJust like the other Persona games, there is a calander system.... eh kinda. While there are events in the game, Strikers is a very story heavy game. Even if the player exits a dungeon, no time/day will pass. Days only progress when the story progresses, so no need to worry about deadlines. There are some Social events that play out and trust me you'll want to get these events. Bonds are what replaced the S-Links, but these serve to improve/upgrade combat and gameplay. \n\nOverall, my experience with Persona 5 Strikers was a great one. I've 100% completed this game 3x (PS4, Switch, and pretty soon Steam). I will say there's an achievement called \"Eternal Bonds\" that takes forever to complete. Even though my playtime shows 30 hours, the game itself is about 45-50 hours (I skipped the cutscenes on steam, but not on PS4) its a lot of content for those who enjoy anime and/or Persona mainline games. I'd highly recommend it. Yes it works with the PS4 controller",

I've played P5 and P5R and there really is no comparison.\nI'm sad to see that there is no confidant system or relationships at all. If you haven't played persona 5 you might not get a few references here and there in this game but it's not impossible to follow along since they explain pretty much everything.\nI honestly recommend P5 on steam if Atlus ever decides to do that.\n\nOn a side note. I thought I was going to enjoy this game more because of the real time combat but in all honesty, this game doesn't give me that \"oomph\" when you land a critical or hit a targets weakness. P5R always made me feel like a badass every time you showtime a group of enemies and in this game it isn't really all that effective. Especially since the bosses tank that shit like it's breakfast.\n\nP5-P5R is just better IMO. I still enjoyed the game and i'm about to finish it soon.",

        "content": "A worthy sequel!\nI'll start off by saying that I dislike \"warriors\"-style games. They just don't do anything for me, but P5S managed to keep me engaged enough that I didn't really care what kind of combat I was dealing with. The battles were a bit more than just mashing the square button and had some variation based off yours and the enemy Personas which was nice. I think my biggest complaint is that the EXP share isn't a flat rate so you're forced to change out party members every 15 minutes if you want them to stay roughly the same level (which you do need to do).\nI could go on and on about the combat, but likely if you're buying the game, you're more here for the characters and setting. \n\nIt was great to have the gang back together (minus Kasumi and Akechi), and overall the plot was really enjoyable. Another thing this game did great was the setting. I thought I would be super bummed not being able to run around Tokyo but all the new locations were super detailed and interesting. I also have to say all the new characters are fantastic. I only wish I got to see Zenkichi and Akechi bounce banter off of each other.\nThere was also some more character development. Nothing ground-breaking but they did give it to characters who could've used an extra couple of minutes in the spotlight (ex. Haru)\n\nAll the new music was great. Obviously a lot of what you hear is recycled from P5 but that is no big deal since P5 has arguably one of the greatest OSTs of all time.\n\n\nDon't expect to drop another 150 hours into the game like you did with the original P5 or P5R as there's just not that much side content, and story isn't nearly as long.\nThe game will net you about 45 to 60 hours depending on if you care about being a completionist.\nOverall 8.7/10",

The changed combat style being changed to a Warriors-style play is a nice change of pace and keeps the game feeling fresh, especially after I just finished playing through Persona 5 Royal. The story is just as intriguing as the original game, it is great to get to spend more time with these lovable characters, and it has an great soundtrack, just like the original P5.",

It was such a great game, if you're into dynasty warriors games it's a lot easier to keep playing the game. However, if you're new to this play-style I suggest moving at your own pace. I promise the game is worth putting a lot of time into. I really liked the music, gameplay, characters,visuals,  Koei and Atlus really did a great job. Everyone in the game had good dialogue, felt like the team really capture everyone personalities. Overall it's a great game, and you should subject yourself to spending 40+ hours trying to beat it and do some phantom request that seems somewhat redundant.",

I have never had a game do this before. People don't launch a separate app just to listen of a song... do better Sega. If you want the DLCs it is still a better price to go with the deluxe edition just don't think you are going to get use out of the soundtrack...they have made it an utterly pointless/useless addition.

        "content": "PREAMBLE:\nI Don't think I can judge this game fairly. I Really did not like persona 5, neither it's main story or it's characters. All the problems I had with 5 are pretty much absent here. They don't gripe about adults every 5 minutes, they don't complain about society every 2 minutes and they also don't talk about how much better they are than everybody every second. I don't know if this game is great or if my low expectations after P5 make it seem great, but I do know that I want the combat and the writers back for Persona 6. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nUnlike P5, this game has active real-time combat as opposed to turn based combat. P5 tried to ad flair and look cool but it fell flat because the characters ended up just standing still and taking turns in combat. The sense of progression and picking the right persona for the job is still here, but with combat that seems to fit the story better. You have basic attacks. You have special persona attacks you can weave in with the basic attacks, and you have your normal persona abilities you know from the mainline series separate from that. This is what persona 5 tried and failed to make you feel, strong and powerful in the face of an army. There are also no more punishments and subsequent incentives to finish a jail in one day. No more time management YAY :D Time management was my biggest gripe with P3-P5, but it's not here.\n\nSTORY:\nDo you want to go on a cross country summer tip with your friends? me too :,( This is just a group of friends doing exactly that, kinda. Saying it's a rehash of P5's story would be a disservice, but it really does feel like the writers saw the potential in it's story and rebuilt it from the ground up. No more cartoonishly evil villains. All of your \"enemies\" are all shown to have suffered greatly and as a result their desires have been twisted. In P5 they were \"twisted\" because the story demanded it. No more \"I know whats best for society\" main-characters. In P5 they were pretty much just like the main villain, but were never called out on it or made to think about it.\n [spoiler] The main \"villain\" this time is actually just the Phantom thieves, but on a much larger scale. He points out that they can't help everyone, that even now while they are talking people are suffering. He want's to become a hero for everyone, to help everyone the phantom thieves can't. His way of doing it is to basically brainwash people, and remove freedom entirely (just like the phantom thieves can be argued are doing to their targets) and when it is pointed out to him that he is basically erasing peoples humanity and becoming like the figure who traumatized him he relents. I am a bit sad that no one pointed out to him that he was punishing the innocent majority for crimes committed by the guilty minority, especially since there was a cop there, but compared to P5 it is flawless. [/spoiler] \nThe characters never stop interacting with each other, so it really does feel like a friends group out on a trip. P5 did little to make them actually seem like friends that would hang out outside of Phantom thieves business, and while this does little to remedy that, it does pair all of them off to some degree. So while they may not keep contact with everyone, they will at least keep in contact with someone. I can see Ryuji and Yuskuke, Futaba and Yusuke, Ryuji and Ann, Makoto and Haru. Just like a real friends group, some of them seem to hit it off better than others. This felt lacking in P5, but there were at least more contained single stories I suppose.\n\nMUSIC:\nYeah, it's pretty good. Some remixes from P5 to make them fit better with the real-time action combat. The jails all have personal BGM as you are walking around just like P5. The first jail has an absolute banger of a track, while the others do their job of building atmosphere well enough. The last one can be argued is alright. The battle music really gets the blood pumping and get you ready for a fight. It makes what happens on screen just feel that more sick. If you bought the battle tracks from the other persona games as well, then you get a good amount of music to make sure you never really tire of any one of them. \n\nFINAL RATING:\nStanding on it's own: ?/10\nCompared to P5: 11/10",

Although the story doesnt add much to the overall series, its still a very fun and interesting experience to enjoy. The combat style is very similar in character to the classic JRPG turn based style, while making it work in real time. I enjoyed every second of my 20+ hours and really hope to see more games like this.",

        "content": "The best Persona spin-off, the best licensed Musou game and a fantastic hack and slash. \n\nKT, Omega Force and Atlus did an amazing job in striking the perfect balance between mainline Persona's RPG elements and the action gameplay of the Musou series. \n\nStorywise, the game follows vanilla P5's ending and allows us to see more interaction between the Phantom Thieves as they travel around Japan for their summer vacation. Writing is expectedly weaker than the main game (as is with Persona spin offs), but the new characters and group interactions pretty much make up for it. I'm not afraid to say Zenkichi is one of the best Persona characters and he carried the whole game. Sorry, it's the truth.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay, back when this game was announced, a lot of people were expecting this to be another mindless button masher like a lot of the licensed Musou games are, but P5S is far from that. Battling enemies incorporates P5's dungeon exploration mechanics to present smaller (when compared to a normal musou) but still fast paced encounters between big numbers of enemies. The addition of elemental magic, buffs and debuffs from the turn based games grants the gameplay a new layer of depth and more ways to deal with enemies other than melee attacks. There is some grind, but it never feels like a chore because the combat is really addictive and super fun.\n\nAs for the rest of the game's elements: amazing soundtrack (as is to be expected from Meguro) and vibrant and stylish UI and overall presentation. My only complaint is that the antialiasing implementation is terrible and if you don't force it with external tools, the game will look blurry and ugly. The port had some serious issues when it came out but most of them seem to have been fixed with the latest patches.\n\nSo, all in all, this is an amazing game. Bit of a hard sell to people who didn't play the original but for those who know what they're getting into, this will be one of the best experiences in the Persona series. Absolutely recommended.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a great game for the fans of the original Persona 5 game (and Royal). It is a sequel, so prior knowledge of Persona 5 is required to get the full experience. Of course, you could still play the game as is, but be warned that there are a few spoilers here and there so I would advise against it.\n\nGameplay wise, it is different from the traditional turn based style the Persona series is known for, that being Persona 5 Strikers is in a style of a musou game with Persona mechanics. This was my first musou game so it took a while of getting used to, but it was fun steamrolling through waves of enemies, and with Persona 5's flashy style and gameplay mechanics, made it a much more enjoyable experience. \n\nIn terms of story, I'd say it's pretty good although that could be my bias towards Persona 5 in general. I do think that if you enjoyed the prequel, you would enjoy this one as well. (I don't really want to say much as I can't really explain without spoilers, sorry.)\n\nLast of all, I want to talk about the PC port. For me, it ran perfectly fine for the most part, but it could be by many factors such as with the new patch (1.02), my hardware, and etc. \n\nFor those who want to know what my hardware I'm using, I'm using a Ryzen 5 2600 and a RX 580.\nThe GPU driver version that I'm using is 20.4.2.\n\nThroughout my playthrough the game only crashed 1 or 3 times but they were at minor parts (like an event with hanging out with Ryuji and Ann near the beginning of the game) so I'm glad it was mostly fine for me and I hope your experience goes smoothly. My computer also didn't suffer from the \"infinite black screen\" bug in the 5th Jail. I would advise to save whenever you can, just to be safe and to keep submitting your game issues to Atlus so that they could look into it and hopefully bring out another hotfix if you are still experiencing issues.\n\nOverall, this is a great sequel to an already great game, and I would definitely say give it a shot if you liked Persona 5 but wanted more content. \n\nWith the success of sales with this game, I hope Atlus and SEGA can continue to bring more of their games on to PC and multiple platforms. I personally do not see the point of having third party game exclusives as bringing games to multiple platforms will not only would bring in more sales, but it can introduce many people to their franchises, and it can make them more popular than they are now.\n\n:D",

I have found solutions for that and now i'm able to play full screen and have my regular load times. I have played a bit of Persona 4 golden, Persona 5, and Persona 5 Royal, so i thought that I would give this game a try. This game's style is very different from those games mentioned before, but I wanted to play this game knowing that and so far i'm having a very good time. (I would recommend playing with a PS4/PS5 controller Mnk works fine too but the others are better) If you have played the other Persona games I would recommend giving this game a try.",

The story was alright but could have been better, the combat felt more of a chore than something you would look forward to and that is not something you want in a game. The bond mechanic and bond skills were slow and knowing that strikers takes place after persona 5 it dosen't make since that they would have to create a bond when they spent the whole year of p5 doing that, most character felt like they lot lost a lot of their character development. I regret buying the game this is not a bias because i was not bad at the combat because i played on hard mode and even then the combat was just right it was not the time i spent playing it\nIf this is going to be your first persona game don't buy this rather buy persona 4 then 5 and if you still want more play the older 3 games then come back to this\n\n<Edit> The games only redeeming quality is the second to last boss fight he is a Dilf that dresses up as a poweranger",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a weird game.  The original game was a turn based rpg but this is a action game with rpg elements.  Think Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy 7 Remake.  Strikers is an actual sequel to the story of Persona 5 (not even Royal but the original Persona 5).  Also the original game is still only available on PS4 so if you don't have a PS4 and want to experience all the story before this point you are going to be shit out of luck.\n\nAll this weird shit out of the way, the game is pretty dang good.  Gameplay is fast and tactical. Lots of fun combos and can weave in persona abilities in-between them.  The music features some original compositions as well as tracks ripped straight from P5. The remixed battle themes are probably the biggest highlights here.  Story is entertaining but can feel a bit too familiar if you already have played Persona 5 before (even the characters will say, \"Hey didn't we do something like this before?\")  The new characters for the most part are pretty well written and interesting.   Voice acting is great.\n\nNow for my complaints.  This game can feel a bit too long especially with the story being predictable.  This isn't necessarily a complaint but I felt like more risks could have been taken here.  I also feel like there is not a huge variety of personas compared to all the other games.  There are a lot of cool ones here but it feels lacking.  A lot of the side quests are also pretty bland and lack creativity.  Kill X guys with X character repeat x50.  \n\nSo yeah, game is fun.  Kind of a hard recommend if you haven't already played Persona 5 as you will be in the dark in quite a lot of details especially character relationships and words like \"Metaverse\" or \"Palace.\"  I would definitely recommend if you already played Persona 5 and are open to action rpg games.  7.5/10\n\nAlso Atlus just put P5 on steam already.  Why the sequel got here first I will never understand.",

        "content": "So, I finished this game last month. It was a really amazing ride and took me around 50 hours to beat. \nAnd well I'll be listing some pros and cons as well as some personal \"feelings\" down the end. Keep in mind, I'll only list the really important parts in this review. SPOILER FREE REVIEW! \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\n[b] * Good story [/b]\nThe story in this game is pretty damn good and works perfectly as a sequel. \nThe Phantom Thieves reunite again to steal the hearts and desires of even more adults on a \"roadtrip.\" That's about what I can say without spoilers. \n\n[b] * The gameplay and 60fps! [/b]\nUnlike all the other Persona games, this one isn't turnbased. It's a hack and slash type of game, but it does it kinda differently. You'll still have to hit the enemies' weaknesses to do more damage and stun them, meaning you still have to think, it'll just be a bit more action-paced. And the combat is also really satisfying. Oh. Did I mention that this game is actually in 60fps? No 30fps cap. \n\n[b] * Visuals and cutscenes look better than they've ever been! [/b]\n[b] * The level design [/b]\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\n[b] * The repetitive story. [/b]\nThis story is really good! But! This Persona game does like every other Persona game, it keeps the same formular in the story. For example, in Persona 5/Royal you go and infiltrate palaces, but most of the palaces are made for you to get another teammate on your team. While this game doesn't exactly do this, it does it in a similar way. You go to jail, turn the shadow good, and then leave again, only to do the same process over and over. While this ain't THAT bad, I really hope that the future Persona games will improve on this. This is why the last bosses in Persona are always so good, because they're so different. \n\n[b] * No social links [/b]\nMakes sense, since this is a very linear game in comparison to Persona 5. Still, I've always loved the social aspect of the Persona series. Sucks that it ain't here since it's what made Persona 5 into my favorite game. \n\n[h1] Thoughts [/h1]\nI really enjoyed this game and I think it's a GREAT sequel. (With a few flaws.) If you love the Persona games (or just love Persona 5) You'll like this game, 100%! It might not be AS good as Persona 5/Royal, but it's still worth playing!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an ARPG triumph and hopefully a template for more SMT action RPGs in the future (it's been too long since the Raidou games).  They took the rough Dynasty Warriors/Musou template, merged with the SMT framework and Persona 5 specific features (baton passes, One More attacks, etc), loaded up each Phantom Thief with a moveset unique and fitting to them, and set you loose.  Combat is fast and fluid, while still being tactical and having that SMT lethality that you expect.  On an overall systems level, they kept what made sense from the base game, while removing or replacing bits that wouldn't make sense (ex. Social links, strict time scheduling).  The result is a game that's paced well, has a lot of challenging and fun encounters, but rewards your growth and skill over time (and your ability to fuse personas with elemental drains and physical/gun attack skills in tandem).\n\nPlotwise, P5S is a direct sequel to Persona 5 (Royal content notwithstanding) and follows a similar enough trajectory as bit of a mirror to the Phantom Thieves' previous Metaverse adventures.  Strikers has the Phantom Thieves go on a summer road trip around Japan dealing with mysterious Jails that are appearing in concert with minor change of heart outbreaks.  In short, it's exactly what you'd expect from your favorite loudmouthed idiot social reformers on vacation, with some hilarious moments and the usual levels of \"Morgana makes stuff up about the Metaverse that ends up being accurate\".  Haru in particular is a riot due to not being saddled with the worst introduction plotline in the base game, and the new additions to the roster fit right into the group dynamic.  P5S won't break any new ground, but if you finished Persona 5 and want to spend more time with this group of miscreants, you'll have a good time with them here.\n\nAll in all, more than worth the money for SMT/P5 fans; if you're not familiar with P5 but are intrigued by this and don't mind some spoilers to the base game, it's still worth a look.",

Perfect translation of Persona gameplay into the warriors settings and in many ways fixes much of the issues I have with combat of both of the series individually. Incredibly fun, well written, beautiful and the soundtrack SLAPS.\n\nPlease don't let this be the last time we get to see the Phantom Thieves in action, need a global tour for next summer break.",

        "content": "I think this game is good like all Persona games. However, there are some problems I have with it, specifically the controls.\n\n1. Although I appreciate ATLUS adding this game to pc, the pc controls are hot garbage and awkward to use without rebinding over half of them.\n2. The buttons on the switch pro controller are all jumbled up. You can fix this, again, by rebinding your buttons to the correct layout but you shouldn't have to do this to make your game enjoyable to play. This also changes the visual ques on the screen. If you're already familiar with the game then it's not a problem. But I get confused when the screen tells me to do one thing but the button does something else.\n\nOverall I think the story is good and the game play and mechanics would be good if the controls worked the way they're supposed to. Unless you have an Xbox controller, then none of this really matters then. But I don't so I'm going to complain.",

        "content": "Hi, I really looked forward to playing this game. Can't recommend it after 10 hours, though. I don't want to continue this. Note: I have not played Persona before, but have watched it on Twitch regularly and roughly know the plot. Also, I'll try to be the devil's advocate here, but don't blame me if I get a little worked up.\nPros:\nThere's no doubt it has awesome cinematics, cool fighting mechanics and controls well. I like Anime. Occasionally, I'll watch one. It's tiring though, how in every new Anime, most of the same ideas always get recycled. Persona, on the other hand, does a good job to come up with interesting new ideas and the characters all have a unique charme to them.\nThe palaces are really fun. I like the hidden chests and objects, the relatively unique combat ideas and the Persona system.\nI played the game on normal mode and it is very well balanced. Plus, the music is great. I do believe some people are overrating the music, but it's still really spicy.\nCons:\nHear me out; I already mentioned that I like Anime. I, too, can invest lots of my time into deeper story and plot analysis. However, if I wanted to play a visual novel, I just would've. The dialogue scenes are cool at first, but they get so boring. At the same time, neither have any of my dialogue 'decisions' made ANY difference on the plot whatsoever, nor am I really willing to completely 'skip' all of them since then I'd have no idea what's going on. And the plot is what people always praise the series for, innit? I don't think it's bad to have long dialogue sequences, but they really OVERDID IT with the frequency. I've spent less time in dialogue sequences in all Life Is Strange games that have been released...\nFurthermore, one is SO limited! I can't underscore this enough. You can't even explore one shop, one sideroad, one small area without any of the characters becoming professor oak lamenting about it 'neither being the right place, nor time'. I have to strictly follow the game's idea of how it wants to be played. It's frustrating. Why, devs? Well, in Pokemon Red (1999) at leat you could enter Pokemarts. Well, ATLUS didn't even bother to animate that in 2021. Again, where is the love? If the game is set in Tokyo, at least try to make it feel like there's a cool shopping experience you can have. The food and medical items you can buy in Persona 5 Strikers are basically all the same (When it comes to TP and SP restoring), they just have different names. By the way, 'Donut-Worry' (restores some health) is the only item/thing in the game that has made me chuckle. Though likeable, the convos are never really... funny. Yeah, the don't have a good sense of humour.\nThe areas are well designed. The artwork and visuals fit perfectly. In Tokyo and other places like Sendai, however, you'll see the same 9-10 character models all the time. Humans in this game appear to be nothing but strange hollows without even a glimpse of a soul. I just really wish they (the devs) had spent more time creating a world that's actually vivid. I wish they had taken more time to make this a good game.\nThe skill tree in this game is ridiculously uncomplex (It's the complete opposite to a game like Final Fantasy X). It's not interesting, it's not individual, and it's not really challenging your decisionmaking/brain either. Heck, they don't even make you do a small minigame or the like when you cook for the rest of the party. \nHyrule Warrios, for anyone who's played that, really sucks at the plot part. But at least I get to PLAY the GAME. And I don't want to wait until I've gained freedom of movement potentially towards the end game. That's simply not a point.\nWe're in 2021 and still nobody expects your game to be as detailed as, say, the Witcher III (2015). In Contrast, with games like The Witcher existing (not a 60 Euro title by the way), how can you even legitimize putting so few love into your towns that you could basically copy from reality and didn't have to make up entirely.\nConclusion:\nI have to add, that the voice acting in this game is superb and the writing too. As english is my second language, I quite enjoy the narrative and style. To be honest, I could probably forget about the cons. Well, if this weren't a 60 Euro game, that is!\nI bought this game on Sale (52 Euro for Digital Deluxe) and that wasn't even worth it. I think at it's current state, the game isn't worth any more than 25 Euro, for there is a huge lack in love for the design of player independence. And hence they try to make it seem like your decision matters in conversations, you can't tell me they're not actually trying to establish the illusion that you do have some independence in this game.\nSince I'm done with school now, soon to be studying at university and thus am short on money, I'll have to continue this game. I merely don't have the money to buy another one. I'll come back to this review once finished. \nIf at all, please keep the comments neutral and respectful. Try convincing me rather than defending your favorite nostalgic franchise.",

        "content": "[h1] Actual, Super-Serious Persona 5 Strikers Review: [/h1]\n\n[strike] it's ok, i guess. [/strike]\n\n\n\nTL;DR: It's a good game, and I don't recommend it for those who haven't played/experienced Persona 5 in any form or fashion.\n\n\n\nP5S is a great sequel for both the base and the Royal re-release versions of Persona 5. Admittedly I [i] am [/i] biased, as I fell in love with this game series since Royal's release and quarantine's abundance of free time. \n\nIt has more of the characters that you love and more of the strategies you employed in P5, all wrapped up with fast-paced hack n' slash gameplay and a decent story that adds new characters that I'll refrain from mentioning any further. If this is your first game with the Phantom Thieves, I sincerely recommend that you [i] not [/i] start here, as all the pre-existing characters are already established in this sequel, and the game wastes [i] no [/i] time re-introducing them or their character arcs. If you don't understand what's going on from the beginning, you'll have to catch up on a lot in your own time, or just run around like a headless chicken and beat the h#%l out of the computer pixels with your skillful excellent button pressing.\n\nMy first run-through of mastering the game (Finishing the story and completing [b] all [/b] of the requests, side-bosses, etc.) took me exactly 69 [spoiler] nice [/spoiler] hours and so-and-so minutes on Hard mode, though I certainly took my time.\n\nI also went through a Merciless NG+ run (only available after Mastering your first run) to finish my achievements list and unlock more powerful [strike] psychological Pok\u00e9mon [/strike] Personas, I finished the achievement list at my current playtime (130.0 hours). While I do love this game, I'm not the type to normally enjoy NG+ runs and that more or less remains the same. I wouldn't recommend it, unless you [i] absolutely [/i] thought the game was too easy. Though be warned, it may feel a lot grindier than the normal Easy/Normal/Hard mode runs.\n\nOther notable things worth mentioning:\n[list]\n[*]I only played on controller, and I recommend you do the same if possible. I'm not familiar with MnK controls, though I hear they're not the best. That preference is up to you, of course.\n[*]The music, as always, is a banger. And has been remixed to fit with this game's faster, more action-oriented combat.\n[*]The fusion system, the Velvet Room, and obtaining masks work somewhat differently compared to P5/P5R, though personally I didn't find the changes of serious significance.\n[*]There are [i] no [/i] Confidants/Social Links, in its place are the traditional RPG-like leveling up of skills, and Combat Mastery by playing different Phantom Thieves.\n[*]Speaking of which, you're able to play as any of the Phantom Thieves almost immediately. Each member has their own special variation of combos, and a unique combat skill that can alter your approach to a fight.\n[*]Unfortunately, no waifu is canon. But (actual semi-spoiler) [spoiler] a certain 5head bestgirl(?) may or may not get more screentime [/spoiler]. \n[/list]\n\n\nAll in all, Persona 5 Strikers burned my bread, revealed the troof, and stole my heart. I lost the mutual respect of my friend groups after they saw me jump into the Persona sinkhole, and after 100%'ing this game I can tell you I've only sunk in further.",

        "content": "I was pretty hyped to get this game when it came out, in fact it's one of the few games I actually preordered because I knew I was getting it no matter what, since I loved persona 3,4 and 5. Plus I really like hack and slash type games, like Metal Gear Rising and Bayonetta. This however, is neither of those.\n\nThis game is a mix of Persona 5 and Musou games. If you like Musou games, you will probably like this, if you don't, but you enjoy persona 5, you might still enjoy it, given that it does differentiate in some aspects\n\nIt plays like persona 5 in the sense that you get to wield personas and it adds a somewhat complex layer to the game\nHowever,  it's pretty boring as far as action games go. It's an average at best game covered with persona 5 elements that makes it seem better than it actually is.\n\n It lacks the polish most persona games have. The bad guys are bland, the main cast interactions feel sameish all throughout the game, the side missions are tedious as all hell, honestly it's a very unrewarding experience. There is no calendar system, there is no confidants, the difficulty is inconsistent... It's just not persona, or a fun game for that matter.\n\nIt's not good. It's not bad either, it's just ok! Not worth the $60 price tag, get it on sale.\n\n\n\n \n\n",

For casual players, it is recommended (specially if you played P5 vanilla) a lot of fun and the combat system is fair enough. Adding new characters that have good characterization and development. Something to add... the music is awesome. The new additions and the remastered versions of the old ones are just better. Anyway, long story short, the game has a good narrative, good game-play along with the awesome music, and amazing addition of new characters.",

I'm pretty far in my social links with the girls in the apartment next door probably 6/7 with both of them . I left them a calling card too to let them know I was going to steal their hearts I know in the game if you date multiple girls is bad but I have until valentine's Day to figure that out.

        "content": "So I really like the Persona series and am planning on getting SMT Nocturne when it comes to steam. I will fully admit that I am biased toward this series and ATLUS in general. So instead of listing reasons you should get this game I will do a Pro/Con/Depends list.\n\nPros: \n- Killer Soundtrack\n- Fun Hack & Slash Gameplay\n- Good Variety of Characters and Playstyles\n- Persona fusing has been changed. It now shows specific recipes for personas, even personas you don't yet own.   \n\nCons:\n- Combat/Combos/Abilities take time to learn and you will be going back to the tutorial menu when you forget which combo casts Zio. \n- No Igor or Akechi :(\n- I'll admit I'm struggling with coming up with cons, but I recommend looking at my next list to see if this game is right for you.\n\nDepends:\n- Direct sequel to Persona 5. This leaves a nice place for players to return to, but could alienate new players. It is worth mentioning that I tried my best to notice when the game made reference to the original P5 and it wasn't super frequent.\n- Shorter than most RPGs. My first run was ~55  hours. Keep in mind I did every side quest I could.\n\nHopefully this encouraged you to get the game. Overall, very fun hack and slash game that I had a hell of a time with. Don't go in looking for something super groundbreaking. Instead go in for a fun, flashy and fantastical game where a bunch of kids go on a road trip. Takes some getting used to, but if my goldfish brain can have fun with this game, so can you.",

It's more relatable and the motives of the villains make you question whether or not you're in the right. From a different perspective, you could even say the phantom thieves are in the wrong in some instances.\n\ngreat experience, 10/10\nleft me with a little bit less depression after I beat it than royal did (which makes sense because royal was more than 2x longer) but still really made me sit there and appreciate the credits.\n\nthanks atlus for finally bringing this over to the west :)",

It really feels like a natural sequel to the first game which was super nice to come back to characters I loved. I will say the gameplay is super iffy.\n\nAt times, its a super fun and competent action rpg. The whole \"warriors\" type games are not my cup of tea but they did a good job making the whole game feel like its not made by that company.\n\nHowever they didn't do a good job explaining mechanics of how the action and jrp persona battle mixes in. The game can either be painfully easy or huge diffuculty spikes of trial and error which isn't fun.\n\nPlus the whole thing where characters you dont use dont level up with you until late game is really bad design. They did it in the last game and Royal so I don't understand why they don't do it for this game.\n\nHowever its a really good game, I just feel the style of game should had either tweaked it a bit more to fit it, or just stayed as a turn based jrpg.\n\nalso put persona 5 on steam and switch you cowards.",

Mouse Camera control has some Acceleration but not a big deal for me. Good thing is you can disable the Auto-Camera (love this option! but it's still have some Auto Center Camera on some Action which is pretty lame)\n\nNote: Lots of dialogue. could be boring for player who hates long down-time. but you can skip/Fast-FWD most of them.\n\n[update: 21 hours-in]\nThe game screen constantly filled with Chat bubbles, Onomatopoeia (comic effect words), and many type of Anime/Comic Effects. it's quite Messy. I know it's their Theme but it's too messy IMO.\n\nGameplays: \n[u]Combat[/u]:\nHard to tell when to dodge (partly cause how messy the effects on screen)\nYou fight with a Party of 1-4 Characters and can switch between them on-the-fly.\nBut in the end, it boils down to Spamming - Press Action when prompt and Repeat. pretty bare bone.\n\n[u]RPG aspect[/u]:\nYou can collect Persona and Fusion them to evolve (somewhat like Pok\u00e9mon) and they have 8 skill slots. They learn more skills and get stronger stats as they leveled up. Main Character (Joker) can switch between several Persona of choice while the Companions have their own fixed Persona.\n\nThe item system is overall pretty awful. the game have small list of Weapons, Armors, Accessories, Consumables. it's a pain to run around looking for the item stores and Vending machine, wasting time and 0 fun.\n\n[u]Summary[/u]\nThe Story each chapter feel pretty much the same. \n1. You go to one town.  2. There's a bad guy. 3. You talk to a few NPC to collect information so you can go to next step. Buy items around the town. \n4. Enter the Jail (Palace dimension) to beat up Mobs, Collect a few orbs.\n5. Come back out to fight 1 mini-boss.\n6. Go back to fight Main boss. and Move on to next town.\n7. Repeat 1-7 for several chapters\n\nThe game is getting Dull over time. but the Style does make some good screenshots too bad there's no Photo Mode. \n\nNot a great / Not terrible game.

        "content": "I bought it again despite already having it on Switch thanks to the sale, and I must admit the 60FPS my gaming laptop can muster makes the game feel suprisingly different in a good way!\n\nThe game already means a lot to me as the whole setting and idea pretty much broke the chains I had been bound upon in my head by myself during the ongoing pandemic. It even learned me how to control my subconcious mind better along the way.\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid. Makes good use of the Persona system and translates it to real-time combat rather than turn-based and even the music remixes are made to complement the change perfectly well! It also just plays a lot better than most Warriors games, with more focus on story to balance out the often repetitive gameplay of these kinda games. It builds more upon a world and its exploration, rather than the 'Select a battle' style most Warriors games have nowadays.\n\nWant a game that can hit you in the feels, and have a amazing soundtrack to go with it along with many other things to love in a RPG, then give this game a go for sure. Switch, Steam, both are good in their own ways.\n\nOh, and finally: Persona 3 (FES), Persona 5 Royal or just the whole Persona series for Switch and Steam when? I'm not asking this like many others are at every single chance to do so, this is even my first time doing it like this. Persona as a series, despite having watched more playthroughs than actually having played it, still really helped me understand myself more as the games show the way people work very well. Persona 4 touches upon acceptance of yourself and your bad sides, Persona 5 Strikers then goes deeper into that idea and instead goes for the way people become due to traumas or other events they might've gone through in the past and can't let go off.\n\nSo another point: If you feel you're struggling with these things, give the series a go (Or a look) and don't take everything at face value. The games have a weird way of showing off the Human mind, but it's actually not all that far-fetched if you really think about.",

Starting with the good:\n\nStory's relatively straightforward, but good enough to keep you strung along. I'm about two thirds of the way through it, so maybe the last bit will blow me out of the water. If you like road trips and mysteries, you might like it.\n\nGraphics/sound/presentation are all amazing. Nothing takes you out of the game, and the music really serves the fights well. Only issues is that you will hear some soundtracks too many times, and there's no ultrawide support :(\n\nGameplay is where it gets interesting. Imagine hyrule warriors but every enemy has elemental strengths and weaknesses, and you can collect enemies like pokemon and fuze them into different, stronger fighters (called personas). There's also basic enviromental attacks that do elemental damage. Add switching between characters as well, and the result is good fun. There's an additional amount of depth in technicals, ailments, buffs/debuffs, but you don't really need to focus on them, even in hard mode. \n\nThe problem is that it, like other warrior esc games, it gets repetitive. Boss battles are supposed to freshen it up, but they mostly fight like other enemies but with quicker attacks and bigger health bars. So, you're gonna do a lot of swinging, casting a spell at a weakness, and dodging regardless of the fight, and not much else. It really would benefit with much more emphasis on inflicting technicals/ailments and switching to different personas/party members to deal damage. Then each fight requires using your brain a bit instead of how it currently is. \n\nUnlike persona 5, there's not much side stuff to do, so there isn't really much to take a break from the combat. Side quests boil down to doing combat challenges, fetching items for party members, or both. A lot of them require you backtrack through previous dungeons too. This game is really only playable for the main story.\n\nIt's still fun and I enjoy it, can't see it being worth $60 though. Wait for a good sale.",

So when Atlus released this, I was exited as hell. I will now say a few things my sister has asked me about it (Also a persona fan)\nWorthy Sequal? Yes\nAs good as original or Royal? Close but no\nWorth it to play on anything its available on? Some better than others but overall yes.\n\nNow onto the actual spoiler-free Review.\nWhile it is different from the Turn-Based battles of the series, it's still a very good game. As I have played some hack and slash games, While I may be a bit biased on this decision, Persona 5 Strikers is my favorite of that genera due to the characters, story, and overall feeling of the fighting. Its nice to have different abilities and still have it feeling like the main series. I still highly recommend playing P5/R before playing P5S if you can.\nThe controls are easy to understand. I personally played with a controller as thats what I use for hack and slash and persona games in general. (Xbox One and Switch Pro Controller for more background) While I dont think its impossible to play with a keyboard and mouse, it would be harder as you only have 8 ways to move. But play how you want to or have the ability to play with.\nOverall, Recommended. With a few aceptions. If you have played or watched a full playthrough of P5/R.",

This game doesn't mention anything that happened in Royal so don't worry about Royal if you haven't played it. If you're into action RPGs or Dynasty Warriors, you're in for a ride just don't expect Social Links and all that. The game is repetitive but at the same time I did not mind at all. The Phantom Thieves were already lovable characters and this game makes you love them even more plus Sophia and Zenkichi (gramps) are the best additions to the Phantom Thieves. My only flaw of this game is that why doesn't Ann or Makoto forget that I romanced them smh \n\nPlease give us Persona 5 Royal, Persona 3, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and the dancing games this is too much but I spend big bucks on it anyways even if I'm broke. :)",

The ability to change characters and fight with different styles helps keep the combat a little bit fresh. You might get bored of repetitive combat but it goes by fast. Getting the bonus BGM from the deluxe edition helped with fights to add more variety too but that is more money to be spent.\n\nI did not have any crashing problems as I played like other people seem to have had, the most recent patch might have fixed that. Some of the CG cut scenes in the beginning had some crusty frame rate but towards the end I noticed it got better. Gameplay was smooth the entire time. \n\nI paid $76 USD for the deluxe edition. I felt like it was worth it for myself, as I am becoming increasingly invested in the persona games. If you're just a casual fan that is not super invested then maybe getting it at $40 or $50 might feel better for you.\n\nIt is a direct sequel to Persona 5 though, so you might want to play that beforehand. Currently, Persona 5 / Royal is only available on the playstation. Hopefully Atlus will port Persona 5 to PC later on.",

They brought us a epic game called Persona 5 not once not twice but three times and all of them are great Persona 5 Great game and Great combat system, Persona 5 Royal same game as Persona 5 but with more to story and new combat types, and Persona 5 Scramble (Strikers) completely new combat system and still nailed it. \n\nThere were few problems with the combat like how some fights you can easily get stun locked and die. The Bonds could have used a bit more work some of them feel like they don't do anything. The Story was great as always with Atlus games. The side quests or as they are known in game as \"Requests\" is a brilliant idea I loved doing them even though some of them seem a bit grindy. The two new characters they added to the persona 5 roster are great (thats all I can say without saying any spoilers). \n\nOver all I say this game is brilliant 10/10 would always play again!~",

        "content": "Spoiler free.\n\nI think its been stated multiple times, but you MUST play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before you play this game. Well, I shouldn't say \"must\" but the impact and fan service in this title is so spectacular if you've played the first entry in the series. Without it, you will 100% be missing out, both on specific story sections, and character (further) development.\n\nLet it also be noted that this game appears to follow Persona 5 more than Persona 5 Royal, due to missing added characters from P5R and specific portraits pulled from P5 rather than P5R. P5R also had a couple story changes, but nothing that should make you want to play P5 over P5R. Pick either one, play it, and then play this amazing game. Don't let the Musou battle system scare you away. This battle system is miles better than anything Dynasty Warriors has done since its creation.\n\n+ The Battle system is fun and skillful. Each character has abilities to learn and unlock and a specific playstyle. Each playstyle can be extremely useful or largely abused (against you) depending on which and what type of enemy you are fighting\n+ Tons and tons of Personas for our Protagonist, just like in P5/P5R\n+ Throbbing King of Desire returns. If you're not sure about this reference, avoid looking it up in public\n+ Great story. Great Characters. Same feeling and writing style from P5/P5R\n+ Same great music\n+ Post game content\n+ Returning entity from P3 (don't look it up)\n\n- Save Often. Crashes from time to time/infinite loading screens. I think the 1.02 patch fixed most of this (at the time of posting this review 4/27/21) as I was having much less crashing upon it's implementation, but not entirely resolved.",

        "content": "Truly remarkable continuation of beloved Persona 5. Strikers is a direct sequel to the last entry of Persona series made by Atlus in terms of plot. However the genre this time is different which mostly reflects in combat, which has moved from classic turn-based style to ripping and tearing dozens of enemies at once. The game is as stylish as its predecessor, but not as complex and long. The characters we all know and love remain such through the whole playthrough. In addition we get two completely new companions, who are an excellent addition to the famous cast. Persona 5 Strikers is a roller coaster of emotions from start to finish. Definitely recommend this product to anyone who's familiar with the series and is open to some innovations.",

This game will definitely be confusing story-wise if you haven't played the original Persona 5 seeing as there are plenty of references to it's predecessor.\n\n*Slight Story Spoilers*\n\nThe game follows the same story structure as Persona 5, and will leave any players who played the previous vanilla Persona or Royal with a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu  by the time you get to the climax and ending. And of course, the story uses the very traditional character trope where there is an abnormal teammate who does not know who or what they are (Used in both Persona 4 Golden with 2 characters, and with Morgana in Persona 5). If these story beats do not deter you, and you like the warriors style combat, you'll enjoy this game overall as I did.",

        "content": "It's Persona 5's sequel - Lite Edition.\n\nThe gameplay is very much like Persona 5's, with a lot of the same. The game is still split in 2 sections, the Metaverse and the  real world. \n\nThe gameplay in the Metaverse is mostly the same as Persona 5's, except for the combat. You'll navigate around, hide in corners and ambushing enemies the same, but instead of turn-based combat it's a Dynasty Warriors style. The fights don't span the entire map like other entries in the genre, but are instead in small, restricted areas. Most of the Persona fight aspects are still there, using Personas to attack, taking advantage of elements, all out attacks, and the like. Ambushes against weaker enemies usually ends up with an immediate All-Out-Attack and winning immediately, though tougher fights do take more time as expected. While fighting, you have 3 teammates with you, which you can control both in fights and while exploring the dungeons. Each teammate has a unique playstyle too.\n\nIn the real world, things are very dialed back compared to the full Persona games. There are no Confidants/Social Links, and most of the confidants from 5 are gone, but not unmentioned. There are no romance options, either. There's no stats to build. There's no time limit on completing the dungeons, you are free to leave and re-enter them as much as you want as opposed to progressing to the next day as is usual. Most of your time in the real world is spent either shopping for items, completing tasks for rewards like new weapons, or just doing story-related tasks such as getting info on the next dungeon boss.\n\nThe story itself I have not completed, but from what I have played it is very enjoyable. The game is very much a sequel to Persona 5, the original version, not Royal. It's nice to come back to the Phantom Thieves.\n\nOverall, while the Metaverse side is quite fun and familiar, the real world side feels lacking and leaves me wanting more. However, I'd still recommend this game. It's still a fun game and the team is as enjoyable as ever, but playing the game makes me want to revisit Persona 5.",

        "content": "A fantastic continuation of the P5 story, though you'll need to have played the original Persona 5 (on PS3) or Royal (on PS4/5) to understand what is going on at all -- as of writing, there's no native PC versions of those games. so maybe hold off on buying this until you find a way to play those.\nStory-wise, the game is more of the same, at least at a glance. Go into Metaverse and change the hearts of villains. However, there are a few twists and turns regarding it this time around that significantly change how it feels, but I will not spoil the specifics.\nIn terms of gameplay, well, this is an action game, not a turn-based RPG. Despite that, it's an excellent translation of traditional Persona gameplay into this new genre. However, you need to be ready to actually rely on melee attacks and items instead of just spamming spells this time around, because the game will drain your SP like there's no tomorrow otherwise.\nAs far as social links are concerned, well, there are none. This is understandable, since you are supposed to already know the characters well enough for this not to be necessary. There are still a few optional sidequests that offer little bits and pieces of character development here and there, but for the most part the game is focused on the main story -- that's not to say that no development occurs [i]during[/i] said main story, though: it certainly does, especially for the new characters.\nAlso, Sophie very cute.",

Empty and uncompelling- there's nothing to search for unless you want some cards or sellable junk. If something spots you, you're forced into a battle unless you run away fast enough, and it's always a group of enemies that you'll Yakuza-fight away with whichever character you've chosen to play as.\n\nHere's the bad thing, though. It's a hard game unless you set it to easy. Why? Literally in the first Jail, you'll find out that the characters are all squishy as hell and get afflicted with status effects constantly. It's extremely annoying, and they'll all usually die while you're trying to take something down. It made me realize that the turn-based system is REALLY needed if you have all these systems in play, cause otherwise you get this game where everyone gets randomly spammed with whatever until they die. The swarming makes it impossible to counteract, too. Oh, and there's tanky damage-sponge enemies aswell.",

        "content": "Kinda late on this since i last purchased but since the game had a patch. I wouldn't know if how much of my criticisms have changed. I think that this game is pretty neat, I wouldn't have had put as many hours as i have put into it if I didn't enjoy it. \n\nParts of the game could have been better, though a lot of my criticisms have been already addressed by a lot of people though I'll say that how leaving the dungeon and coming back to restore hp and more importantly sp is kinda dumb that it just doesn't heal automatically, I guess its to have the feeling of during new game plus or whatever the player can feel like they didn't need to come back and rejuvenate but doesn't really feel like its needed aside from possibly needing to stock up on items which could just be done anyways.\n\nThe story is fine I liked parts of it can't say I'm too much of a fan though even if it is just mostly dumb fun, I like some of the new characters but that's about it. \n\nThe game would crash on me a unusual amount of times for almost no explainable reason, I detected a pattern some of the time with like traveling between the velvet room and back or like leaving the game on in the background for a realllllly long time and then it would crash after some transition back to the real world, but other times i really couldn't explain why like during story events, so I just got used to save somewhat often since it barely takes that much time.\n\nI got a unusual amount of time trying to assemble some heavy hitting personas (even if lucifer is just the best for dealing with large groups) and figuring out a lot of the different combos that come with those personas and even different party members, its all built pretty well. In the case of joker though being able to switch out to a persona that nulls or absorbs a attack was pretty satisfying though it also kinda feels like there's not really a reason not to freeze time to null a attack instead of like dodging or something, due to how most attacks don't really move when you freeze time and select a different persona, aside from some attacks acting during that time but barely ever happens. I think if a sequel or a different SMT spin off as there could be a lot to expand on here gameplay wise. \n\nIf you like this series there's not really a reason to not get the game but just gonna say I'd wait for a discount because despite all the good I don't think its worth 60 bucks, and I especially don't think it was worth 70 bucks even if I got to access it 3 days early and some music dlc/extras which in all honesty ain't much : P (Or you could just buy it anyways). ~~I'm sure I'll complain about the price of things more as soon as nocturne hd comes out~~",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is still Persona, but instead of Turn based you get Warriors-style hack-n-slash battles. Atlus and Koei really made this game work amazingly, perfectly translating the persona 5 battles into warriors style. The game just as stylish and the writing is just as good, if not better then Royals. All the new music and remixs feel great and unique while still feeling the same. Although the game has some issues running on PC, it still runs well enough to play. The Digital Deluxe in-game DLC I find really adds to the game having the older music from the series' past. Although the Deluxe's bonus content is just a unity project, which means you don't get the soundtrack directly as music files. Atlus actually updating this game on PC to make it more stable is great, just wish they'd fix the optimization issues it has.",

        "content": "I wasn't convinced about an action-based Persona game, but having completed it, I couldn't have asked for a better spin-off.\n\nThe game previews show Joker facing off against massive swarms of enemies, giving the wrong impression of a musou-like hack-and-slash. Those big brawls are there, but most mob fights are far more similar to a traditional persona confrontation, against a handful (around 10) enemies with different weaknesses, and we could always pause the action by holding down the right bumper, so it's a real-time with pause action game.\n\nEverything takes place within the summer holidays, so Strikers is shorter in both story and character development, but the main cast is as likable as ever. The timeline is a direct continuation from the original P5, but it's somewhat jarring that the other characters seem to have forgotten their relationship (if any) with Joker. Also, considering that the Phantom Thieves are already embedded in the public consciousness and they're stirring up quite a storm this time, it's awkward to not hear a single peep from their outer circle of confidants. The Mishima we know would have gone ballistic from the stuff they're doing this time around.\n\nGameplay-wise, party members mostly reprise their original roles in P5. For example, Skull is still a powerhouse in boss fights; he's actually better than Joker until Joker's personas are fully developed. Mona is still a reliable wind hitter / heal battery, and he can transform into his van form to road rage into enemies again and again. Fox's playstyle centers around countering single physical hits with his own, and a few members can imbue their normal hits with their native element, bypassing physical resistance or immunity. Ammo fully regenerates after every fight. Noir (when mastered) can shoot for free, and certain members have ways to replenish mid-fight.\n\nThis time around, the Personas and fusion system are a bit more interesting. Having come from the original P3 and P4, it was far too easy in P5 (and P4G) to put any skill into any persona, rendering the nuance in inheritance slot limitations, elemental restrictions, and multiple fusions completely moot. I'm pretty sure everyone's glad that random inheritance is gone, but P5's system made it such that personas without unique skills are only as good as their innate resistances or growth potential i.e. the lower their initial level, the better, so many personas that start at high level, e.g. Messiah and many arcana capstones, are no good. It made no sense.\n\nIn this game, there are no personas locked behind DLC, and on top of the 8 skill slots, each persona has up to 3 combo skills that cost no SP or HP. These are innate to each persona, and they restore personas' much-needed identity. For example, want to combo into a free maziodyne? Thor is our only pick. Mara has its own unique combo-only severe fire skill called maralagidyne. Skill cards are still there, but they cannot modify these combo skills, and the best ones only drop at the very end of the post-game of NG+, so if we want good personas earlier on, especially when just going into Risky / Merciless difficulty, fusion is the way to go. There's also no limit on persona stat growth, so if we have the resources, there's no problem enhancing all stats to 99.\n\nDefense passives such as absorb element that are traditionally extremely powerful in turn-based persona, are not very relevant here, because we could just switch to another persona at any time. Enemy moves are clearly telegraphed, and baton pass, showtime, as well as all-out attacks all confer generous iframes, on top of dodge roll. That's before factoring in the omnipotent orb. It's a very interesting change-up in terms of how an end-game persona is supposed to look like.\n\nThere's also surprisingly little grind in this game, which is really welcome. I'm sitting at 100% completion with about 100 hours on my file from just playing through normally, and Joker's personas and four other members are already all maxed out. If you want to max everyone's stats with incenses, that will take a few hours fighting the reaper on Merciless difficulty (he drops 75 incenses in one go). Or if you absolutely need some skill card, e.g. any drain card. For that, good luck, because some of the drop rates are really, really low.\n\nAs for things that could be improved, a persona's combo moves aren't shown in the compendium, so the only way to know is to try them out or look them up. Analog movement is also really iffy even when using a controller; your character is locked into 8 directions of movement. It's bad when moving around, but surprisingly enough, it doesn't get in the way during fights.\n\nAs a separate issue, once Joker's personas get powerful enough, it becomes possible to just endlessly stunlock most bosses by inflicting burn, freeze, or shock, and then literally just doing hassou tobi / vacuum wave over and over with knockdown style and technical adept. That's... a really boring way to play the game, but it's also the fastest way to bring down the boss. That's no good.\n\nHere's to a simultaneous PC release for P6, eh Atlus? Maybe include a difficulty option to disable skill cards for fusion purists.\n\nA few tips for Risky / Merciless difficulty: Start with at least a good persona or two, e.g. Yoshi, and max Navi's HP first, for the defense sections. The best way to spawn treasure demons for money and skill cards is to just move around or change zones when alert level is in the red, after clearing at least one group. They have a distinctive way of scooting around the minimap, and they give off a continuous tinkle even when not in line of sight. In the final dungeon, treasure demons give 750k yen with the money accessory, and you should be able to get one to spawn every 5 minutes or less. Dire shadows are best for bond points. For PP, just keep enhancing and dismissing the same persona over and over.\n\n\nBottom line: Don't miss this if you're a persona fan.",

        "content": "I love this game. 10/10 because the writing and the characters were consistent with Persona 5. It literally feels like Persona 5 like all the characters you were friends with going on a road trip across Japan. I didn't think the sequel of Persona 5 would be good, but it turned out amazing af. They added new characters in the game that I truly fell in love with throughout the story. This is the game that tbh everybody has good character and I liked all them.  Indeed was a good game I thought I would hate the fact that the game is not Turn-based like the original Persona, BUT honestly I like the fighting mode better when I actually played it. Because you get through \"jail\"(which is the P5:Striker's Palaces) is so much easier than palaces in the OG Persona. The fighting is also pretty sick. Even the soundtracks are as amazing as the OG Persona 5. You know the GAME is good when I played it everyday when I got it, or waiting after doing work and playing it. So far my favorite quarantine game to escape from reality",

The story is detailed and great. I personally skip it sometimes because it's a ton of dialogue but the content is quality and human. Great game to relax.\nThe moves are simple and fun the brawling and mechanism feel perfectly integrated with the rpg elements and the world plus the story make it all for a very immersive experience.\n\nI still prefer Persona 5 though hopefully they port that to PC. I already have it on console but It's way too convenient being able to play persona on just my laptop PLEASE DO THIS NOW",

When the game was announced I was expecting it to play exactly like a Warriors game, and I would've been content with that, I kind of like musou games. However, it surpassed my expectations. The gameplay is fun and all the characters feel distinct enough, on the harder difficulties you have to think about what skills to use and when which adds a layer of complexity to the gameplay.\nThe plot is nothing spectacular but it's good enough to make you want to play through the whole game.",

I was hoping I would like this hack 'n slash game as I have a tough time enjoying the genre, but this game just isn't for me. The game was also fairly unstable while I played, though I won't say anything more because hopefully the new update fixed it for the persisting / new players.",

        "content": "I put around 100+ hours into both P5 and P4G respectively, so I have some amount of experience with this franchise.  In short, this game is fun as hell.  Now for the long part.  The combat is fast paced and has interesting mechanics to boot.  You would think that pausing the game in order to select a skill from a menu would be detrimental to the pace of battle, but it actually isn't. Furthermore, every member of the Phantom Thieves has their own unique playstyle, which kind of implies that each PT member has their own situational usage.  Joker has his usual \"wild card\" sitch, Ryuji is the heavy, Morgana becomes a car, Ann has an enchant, Yusuke is a Fire emblem character, you can finally ride Makoto's bike, Haru is a beyblade, and the two new characters each have their own thing going on too.  Sophia is a great addition to the PT, acting as kind of a Morgana 2.0 from P5, (she navigates the PT to and through the Jails, which are like Palaces from P5, so no Sophia means no game) considering she's an amnesiac who has no clue what her origin is.  However, instead of being quite annoying like our favorite mascot, Sophia ends up being one of the most likable characters in the whole game.  Then there's Zenkichi, who's basically Dojima from P4 [spoiler] but he's a Persona user [/spoiler].  He is also an amazing addition to the PT, acting as a kind of \"team dad,\" who looks out for and genuinely cares about his team, his family, and justice.  The villains in this game are also pretty great.  Instead of being one-dimensional hate sinks like in P5 (not R), these guys have more depth to their actions, usually acting the way they are due to trauma and abuse from earlier points in their lives.  Main bad guy is kind of a toss up though, since I still think Shido had so much going on in P5 that it's really hard to even come close to him, and [spoiler] Konoe [/spoiler] felt less diabolical once you learn his backstory.  Overall, I think this game is great, but I did have some issues with fullscreen and had a few crashes.  Definitely worth the buy!",

As someone that played a single Dynasty Warrior game like two decades ago, hated it, and never played another, this was an amazingly fun experience. That said, it's defiantly still a Persona game, which is good. Weakness and Technical attacks are the biggest key to actually getting anything done so it's not just mindlessly spamming the same combo every which way the wind blows. Technical hits in particular are vastly more important then in P5/Royal since you can Ailment bosses and especially trigger Technical hits that will chip away at enemy shields (which is necessary for the few enemies with no Weaknesses).\n\nI would only recommend people interested to hold off if they haven't played P5/Royal since it is a sequel. On that note, the events of Strikers seem to be based off the ending of P5 rather then the true ending of Royal. No mention of Yoshizawa.",

        "content": "I enjoyed the game, but it is not without flaws.\nTLDR: The game crashes, save frequently. Combat is fun but some fights can drag on too long. The plot is fine, nothing special but having the gang all together in new places has some great interactions. If you are a fan of the Phantom Thieves and can stomach the potential crashes and gameplay issues, get it. If you aren't invested in the characters, there isn't much reason to get this over other action games.\n\ncrashes - In the 60 hrs it took me to beat the game on normal and do all requests, the game crashed several times during loading screens. There are few things more frustrating than beating a tedious optional boss and then the game crashing when you leave the area.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, each story boss has a unique design and arena that makes their fight interesting. Mini-bosses not so much, they felt more like tedious resource drains. The optional bosses even more so, spamming skills to destroy their guard just to have your fully upgraded all-out-attack move the hp bar 10 pixels doesn't feel great.\n\nUnlike other musou games, melee kinda takes a back seat. The combination of melee doing small chip damage and 100 things flying around the battle, makes melee risky and unrewarding and persona skills far superior. Other than generic grunts, if you are approximately the same level as an enemy they don't especially care about any attacks that aren't the element they are weak against. Each character has a combo or 2 that deal their element as damage without using sp, but the real deal hits harder. You're gonna want to stock up on sp recovery for challenging fights.\n\nThere are some fun character interactions as the thieves interact with each other in new situations and environments. I also love the new characters. There is nothing from royal since the games were being made at the same time, so don't expect 3rd semester character growth to be present here.",

        "content": "A hack n slash rpg should be easy to come to grips with, a pick up and play experience.  Persona 5 Strikers is not that.  This game has all the complexity in mechanics and gameplay of the mainline series squished uncomfortably into a far more fast paced game.  You must still juggle multiple persona types and hit weaknesses while making sure to not deplete your SP, but now with the added annoyance of large scale battles where you must also weave and dodge attacks.  Too many times I've lost fights because my team didn't have the correct type matchups, or we burned through all our SP in a single strong enemy encounter.  These are fine in a 100+ hour turn-based RPG, but it feels VERY out of place in a Dynasty Warriors-style hack n slash.  \n\nI loved Persona 5 and there are times when I love Strikers, but it's far too complex to enjoy consistently for me.",

Showtimes and All-Out Attacks are hype af\n\nStory is more linear than the original game but the cast is as enjoyable as ever. Voice acting for the English version is mostly excellent, despite the difficulties they had recording during the pandemic.\n\nPersona fusing has been simplified with less options, which has in turn made that part of the game less enjoyable than mainline persona games. There are also less personas to fuse and collect in total.\n\nThe game also suffers a bit from having unbalanced difficulty scaling. It goes from being somewhat challenging in the beginning, to becoming quite easy in the end due to increased HP and SP resources. Merciless difficulty fixes this a bit in NG+, with the consequence of making minibosses too tanky.\n\nBut overall I would say that Koei Tecmo has done a great job implementing turn-based RPG elements into an Action RPG. All in all a worthy sequel to P5.",

Gameplay is better than you think, really fun and the transition from JRPG is really smooth. My one complaint with this game is it isn't the most stable, but then again, there are known fixes and can really easily be patched soon. Overall, I would get this on PS4/PS5, but the Steam one is a close second. Definitely Recommend if you played Persona 5",

Good thing the battles are crazy fun, swapping from a turn based to open world combat system is one of the best changes to the persona formula imo. The personas are all unique as well despite joker being the only one to wield multiple. The new characters, villains, dialogue, features, and boss fights all make for a wonderful experience. Atlas has outdone themselves yet again, give the game a try if you have $60 to spare!",

You can use any controller you can connect to Steam for this game but you need to launch the game with the controller already in use on the PC. I recommend launching the game from \"Big Picture\" mode. \n\nOne major issue (at the time of this review 4/13/21) is a crashing issue. My game has crashed when entering Jails (this game's version of a Palace) and during transition sequences within the Jails. So i HIGHLY recommend saving at EVERY possible chance you get or you will lose progress when it crashes.\n\nMusic is great, just like in every other Persona game. \n\nGameplay is obviously different but once you get used to it you will enjoy it, especially if you like games like Dynasty Warriors. Being able to play as any character in your party is a nice touch and having (almost) every beloved Phantom Thief unlocked right away is a good touch. Joker's Wild Card still lets you get Personas, but now instead of convincing them to join you they will instead sometimes drop masks when defeated. Fusion is more or less the same with some new mechanics that are easy to understand.\n\nSophia is new best girl?",

After awhile, you can't even enjoy the music since you are way too powerful for the normal minions, Even on hard. Go in, all-out-attack and repeat. The mini-bosses are fun and should be integrated more and much more often. \n\n-In my 60 hour gameplay, I crashed 5 times. That's not really game breaking but a bit annoying. And it's random too. My pc specs is above average ( ryzen 7 3700x & RTX 3080 ). Your mileage might differ, but 5 times in 60 hrs is kinda annoying since there is no autosave. \n-Why release the sequel on multiple platforms and not the original? really weird decision making.\n\nConclusion\n-For persona 5 players : instant buy\n-normal people : play persona 5 first\n-for people who hate weeb stuff : hell no",

        "content": "A fantastic game, but not for the reasons I expected. Let's go over the good and the bad of this game (and it's mainly good) \n\n1) The gameplay is actually fantastic. \n\nI was worried when I heard that this was going to have Dynasty Warriors style combat. After slogging through Hyrule Warriors, I expected a lot of dull and repetitive fights, but they really did a great job of converting Persona 5's turn based combat system into real time. You swap between characters with a press of the button, throwing out their abilities and dodging enemy attacks as you keep the combos going. \n\nThe emphasis is still placed on hitting elemental weaknesses, casting buffs/debuffs and all that, but style is the name of the game when it comes to Persona 5. Just like P5, you can end a fight with an equal-level foe in 5 seconds with a nice ambush or stop a boss dead in its tracks with well selected attacks. The flow is absolutely perfect and every \"SHOW'S OVER!\" splash screen feels well earned. \n\nThere are a few flaws. There's only ONE time in the entire game when you can use all your party members at the same time and the progression of spells (Agi --> Agio --> Agidyne) is rather dull, but it's still a thrilling experience. I would not mind if every Persona game from this point forward used a combat system like this. \n\nGameplay: 9/10 \n\n2) The story is pretty cool, though nothing show-stopping. \n\nAt the end of Persona 5, everyone's character arc is pretty much resolved with a clear endpoint. Our entire cast starts the game as a group of well-rounded individuals who have for the most dealt with their inner demons. This means that we're in a situation where a lot of the game is about a group of good friends who are entirely chill with one another going around kicking ass and solving problems. \n\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Essentially, the story is a chance to hang out with eight characters who you already like from the first game for a while. And you know what? That was actually a good feeling. Even during the moments of high drama in the plot, I found it to be a really relaxed affair. There was a certain comfort in being in such familiar surroundings. If you've played the first game, then you've already spent 100+ hours with these people and they're your friends. And being around friends is nice. \n\nI don't think anyone that hasn't played the first game would like this though. \n\nStory: 8/10\n\n3) Surprisingly, there's almost no romance stuff. \n\nThe story is a direct sequel to Persona 5, but it's apparently a version of Persona 5 where the player character chose to not date anyone. Or maybe he just chose not to date any of the Phantom Thieves girls and is actually having menage a trois with the teacher and doctor characters. Whatever. \n\nRegardless, if you were expecting to get some extra scenes with Makoto out of this game, then you'll be unpleasantly surprised to learn that there is a grand total of ONE moment in the entire game where you can ask someone to spend time with you in a romantic context, and even that is just some five minute nothing-happening scene. I was kind of shocked by this. I mean, the waifu stuff has to be about 37% of the reason people like Persona games, right? Why would they just entirely ignore that? I don't understand it.\n\nWaifus: 3/10 \n\nOverall: 8.5/10 Highly recommended, especially for anyone who's played Persona 5. The world needs more Persona games.",

        "content": "While this game's combat mechanics are fun and fresh in their divergence from Persona's normal turn-based gameplay, the story (while it has its moments) is a boring retread of material from past Persona games, and apart from the fanservice for players of Persona 5 I can't recommend this game on the merits of its narrative. The character of Sophie and her story arc is basically a recycling of Aigis from Persona 3; Zenkichi is just Dojima from Persona 4, the reprisal of the Persona 3/4 hot springs scene (they are all the same scene) is unnecessary, unfunny, and tired. etc.\n\nI'm a pretty big Persona fan, and I've enjoyed this game. Its story is serviceable, not embarrassingly bad or even unenjoyable. But if you have played a Persona game, and especially if you have played Persona 3 and 5, you have played this game. The only difference is the gameplay, which, again, is still fun. I do appreciate them cutting the social links/calendar bullshit, because that was never really used well in past games, but there is still far too much busywork in between the dungeon crawling and combat\n\nThe PC port is fine, at least as far as I've found. It's only crashed a few times for me. But ymmv i guess\n\nHaru also continues to be good.\n\n[b]tldr; good combat, boring recycled story, slightly unstable port. play if you really need that much more persona in your veins, probably buy on a sale, don't expect too much. 3/5 - decent.[/b]",

        "content": "Having finally finished Persona 5 after playing through it for six months, I decided to hop onto Persona 5 Strikers as soon as I finished. I can't say I have anything substantial to say about it yet, I'm only an hour in and god knows that these games go on forever. What I can give are general impressions that might influence otherwise prying eyes:\n\n- Do I recommend this if you haven't played Persona 5 yet? So far, no. Do I think it's a requirement, though? Also no. The general impression I've gotten so far is that if you haven't had the chance to play P5 yet, it'll be weird hopping into this story with all of these characters you haven't met yet, but if you really don't have any choice, you'll make do.\n- If you HAVE played P5, you'll notice that this takes some pretty big departures from what was in that game. Most notably in the combat, which is this game's main selling point, but the area that I think will be the most contentious is that there isn't any Social Link system. P5S is a lot more linear than its predecessor. I don't think that's a bad thing, necessarily; there's so much to do in P5 that I'd happily start a new game if one hundred more hours didn't seem daunting to me. But, if that's what you really loved P5 for, it's best that you set your expectations at the gate before stepping into Strikers. This is a spin-off that acts as a semi-sequel of sorts, but no, I wouldn't call it a full-on sequel.\n- The combat is what will make or break this for you. As I said, it's the main selling point and they've stripped out all of the non-linear segments from the original game to focus on it. From what I've played so far, it's pretty typical of a Musou fighter. There's a billion enemies on screen, you have your teammates on the  side, go beat the shit out of everything that you see. They did implement some of Persona's systems, in that you do still have your gun and can cast your Persona onto enemies who might have elemental weaknesses. That's cool, but it doesn't seem very deep so far. Again, these are impressions.\n- Other than the combat and lack of the Social Link system, they've managed to maintain the Persona 5 style down to a tee. You have your animated cutscenes, fantastic score, cell-shaded art style, all the way down to the way conversations play out. Pretty impressive, seeing as I was expecting this to just be beating the shit out of everyone on screen.\n- The PC for this is... okay? It's not bad, and minus some crashing issues that have been reported, it runs well. If you're going to play this on PC, though, keep a controller on hand. You can rebind the controls, which is neat seeing as the default control scheme borders on being decent to \"who the fuck thought this layout made any sense at all?\", but it really just works better with a controller.\n\nI hope to write a fully fledged review when I'm done with this, too.\n\nAlso, Atlus: [i]bring Persona 5 to PC[/i]. If not Royal, then at least bring the original version over? Like, I get that you're still trying to test the waters and it'll take a little while to optimize your engine to run on PC, that's okay. But releasing the semi-sequel to a game that's exclusive to one platform and having it being a multi-plat title before the original game gets ported to anything else is just kind of funny to me.",

        "content": "I find myself very in between on this game I love Persona 4 & 5, the story and game play are fantastic, I also love the fast pace of Koei-Tecmo's Samurai/Dynasty warrior games. With that being said this game should totally be up my ally right. Well long story short I enjoyed the story, the game play was just OK. A lot of the time It was hard to follow what is going on in fights and the difficulty spike on the first mini boss was jarring. I think again story wise the game is pretty good more time with the phantoms thieves and overall comes to a satisfying conclusion. The game play is the weak point for me, I also wish the hub cities were bigger/had more to do, with all that the game is worth getting for story alone and the overall environments the jails present are visually really cool, but again I had trouble with the fighting/abilities or really investing in any of the other characters abilities( played joker pretty much exclusively) *spoiler really sucks if you haven't done this by the end of the game*. recommend for story but game play is hard to get into that's just my opinion. Story also felt a little long by the end of it and this is from someone who has played Yakuza: like a dragon, Persona 4 & Persona 5.",

Significant character growth was literally non-existent.\n- Copious frame rate drops during jails; could just be my specs but HOT DAMN did they bust my ass.\n\nVerdict: If you're looking for fluid gameplay or just love Persona, you're in for a treat.

        "content": "I haven\u00b4t played any Dynasty Warrior games so I cant judge how well this game does stuff compared to comparable titles, so this comes from a guy who just really likes Persona 5.\n\nIf you are a fan like me, you should definetely give this game a try! It\u00b4s more time with the phantom thieves and their members, which is great. Sure, you dont have to manage school-life or your confidances, and battles are fought in real time, but it still FEELS all Persona 5-ey. If you played the original (or Royal) you know what I mean, the style, the music and the whole atmosphere.\nIt\u00b4s just a bit different, but I would like to stress that that\u00b4s not a bad thing. You just feel a different kind of rush and excitement when you have to control the movements of the thieves directly in battle, The change in genre fits surprisingly well (at least for me)! Before you had all these thievy characters in a rather static battle-system, this one allows you to experience much better how the phantom thieves sneak around enemies or weave through them, and it feels awesome.\n\nSo yeah, watch Queen screaming FIST OF JUSTICE while the new Last Surprise track is blasting and try to tell me you dont love this. \n\n10/10, more \"For reals\"s from Ryuji\n11/10 Ryuji drops the f-bomb finally",

Another gripe I have is with the level design. It just comes off as not professional. At one point there is a puzzle that was so easy I laughed. The writing for the characters has lowered in quality from the first. Everyone's words just feel hollow. My main source of fun in P5S was in persona fusions and actual fighting.

        "content": "After completing everything this game has (Merciless Mastered), it's a really great and even if you're trying persona 5 for the first time, you could hop in and have a great time with the characters. Though of course, HIGHLY recommend that you play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal before entering here as you'll get to be more attached to the characters beforehand.\n\nI've never really played any kind of game like this in the past so I started on normal and that was already a good enough challenge personally. So don't worry about starting on normal if you're not looking for a challenge, that's why there's a merciless mode for those who want to challenge themselves. I think starting on hard mode is also a good enough challenge for those starting out. \nI think the gameplay is near perfect for those who want to either take it back and just play casually and those who really want to challenge themselves. The mechanics are simple but if you want to be able to maximise your output you have to be strategic with quite a lot of things. Combo's with normal attacks, combo's into your persona, and evading your enemy, while you can button mash, you'll get punished for not knowing what you do in hard boss fights and especially on merciless mode. Merciless will destroy you if you aren't being conscious of what you're doing in terms of attacks and spacial awareness, if you get caught by an enemy you'll most likely be dead, your entire party included.\nStarting on normal and then switching to hard later on I feel is the best thing to do. Normal will teach you the main mechanics well while hard will challenge you on using those mechanics to the best of your abilities. Merciless will challenge everything you have mechanics and resource wise. \n\nWhile the story isn't too heavy handed in terms of twists and complexity, it's a very enjoyable one with barely any bad moments. The dynamics between the characters are honestly written very well and they really do feel like a band of merry friends at the end of the day. And the new characters are amazing too, they're a very nice addition to the group.\nMusic is top notch, seriously, I don't have a single song I hate in this game. From city vibing, to the many and various battle themes, there's so much to enjoy.\nAnd I do love me some boss fights. I really do like all of them. While some have some annoying mechanics, they aren't frustrating to deal with.\n\nIf you've seen other reviews, then you've seen that this game has a complaint of crashing. And yes it does, I had quite a few in the beginning but I kind of learned a trick that could help others if you're having the issue as well.\nDuring transition screens whether that's areas, the metaverse, or after boss battles, that's where the game usually crashes (at least for me). Don't furiously click or press any keys during these transitions. Rapid clicks or pressing of the keyboard have caused like, 99% of my crashes so while it may be different for others, those with the issues may find that this will help and hopefully it does.\n\nBut yeah, it's an amazing game. I hope this review helps in some type of way as I felt it was necessary after getting all the achievements possible in this game.",

        "content": "Quick heads up before you play this game,\nThis game is a direct sequel to Persona 5 and you will be lost playing this without understanding the story of Persona 5. Although the developments from Persona 5 Royal are kinda disregarded here, I'd recommend playing that instead of base P5, if not for the improvements on the base game then purely for the Third Semester.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a hefty addition spanning (in my case) 50 hours long. A third of P5R and half of P5. The combat here heavily resembles that of dynasty warriors, in which you have to fight off hordes of opponents in real time with 3 more phantom thieves by your side. The story here is kind of weak compared to P5R, but still really enjoyable and fulfilling besides. If you have played P5 or P5R, I'd highly recommend this game as despite the main 8 thieves not getting much character development (as they already got all of it from their confidants in P5), it is still nice seeing them ebb and flow off each other and the two new main characters.\n\nTime to go on a trip with P5S and steal back some desires.",

The jails don't feel like Warriors battlefields, they feel like dungeons. Not saying that's inherently bad, just wasn't what I was expecting. The writing isn't amazing, in fact they somehow managed to make the characters feel even more one note than they did in the first game. But persona spin offs are always like that, let's be real all of us were going into this expecting that. If I could give this a neutral rating I would. Overall I'd say it's good but probably worth waiting for it to go on sale. I don't think it's worth a full 60 bucks.",

I would recommend playing the first game if you want to understand this game on a conceptual level. The gameplay is smooth and tight, the combat is fun.\n\nThe open combat style actually fits surprisingly well with the Persona roster of abilities and demons. And I imagine we are able to take out hordes of shadows because I ended the last game at LVL99. It all just kinda works, and if you have a craving for more persona this just might scratch the itch.",

        "content": "First of all I want to stress one thing. If you haven't played persona 5/5R, most of this game won't make sense to you. The entire premise and story is built on the previous game to the extent werre you would need to look up every twist and turn in the story. This is by all accounts made for people who played the Persona 5.\n\nFor veteran players, this game is good if you want more phantom thiefs. More details below.\n\nPros\nIt's a solid story with no major plot holes.\n\nIt works in canon with Persona 5 without bending the worlds rules.\n\nThe new combat system is acceptable, but not all mechanics from previous Persona games make sense here but they have tried and mostley succeeded\n\nThe banther between characters are still as good as Persona 5, but this time you are not forced to think of the best answere to grow any character bonds.\n\nCons\nTime management is gone, the clock only moves once the main quest is complete.\n\nThey gutted the social stats with no replacement\n\nThey gutted the Arcana system and Social bonds and replaced it with the \"B.A.N.D\" System. \n(It's an attribute system, Increase HP by 5 points etc.)\n\nRomances are gone.\n\nVelvet room is a straight copy from Persona 5 but needs it's own list\npros\nAttribute boosts no longer needs incense\nlevel boosting is now a quick process.\ncons\nArcana boost is gone\nNetwork fusion and other special fusions are gone.\nMistakes now replaces all skills not only the inherited ones.\n\nThe bosses are lacking when you compare them to P5. This is an reacurring issue, the lack of time in this game means that there is no room for fleshing out characters. We know the Phantom Thiefs but who is the bad guy, more then: Scared boy growing up to be insecure, given massive powers and is now evil.\n\nMultiple cities look cool on paper, but in practice is a mess. The city is also a character in these games. Getting to know the locals in persona games is what makes the cities feel alive. Not being able to interact with the cities you travel to makes them feel like set pieces rather then cities.\n\nThe new members are cool on paper but lack pay off. The game focus on them a lot, but don't seem to have too much to say about them.\n\nThe palaces can now be revisited, this might sound cool. But in order to make the palaces replayable, they have insted gutted the character developement of the villain via his/her palace. The symbolism is also suffering a lot because of this and there is a prime example in the very beginning of the game. Example below contains spoilers for the first 2h:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Your first palace/Jail (it makes sense in the story)\nYou are infiltrating a jail that is owned by a pop idol. She was bullied when she was little and is now one of the most famous people in Japan. She gets the power to change people's hearts and she uses the power with no mercy because of her past.\n\nThey describes her as playing with people like toys. Therefor the entire jail is filled with toys and is a medieval castle for some reason? even though it's a shopping mall with parts of shibuya.\n\nAnyway. You get captured early on and the Idol wants you to be her toy, you refuses (duh) and she says \"Hmmm so you don't want to play with me, then you are a broken toy.... and broken toys is thrown in the trash\" Then they litterly throws you into a garbage room 2 blocks away.\n\nCompare this to the previous game where every action in the real world had a theme based counter part. I am mostly thinking of Kaneshiro's viewing people like ATMs and unuseful people are busted ATMs or Okumura's Palace where the employees are robots and and broken robots are thrown into the smelter and are concidered as fuel. When you learn that Okumura is running his company with an iron fist and by inducing fear in them to lose their job, There is clear symbolism.",

        "content": "Having played and 100% Persona 5 originally, I was quite excited to get back into the world of Persona 5. The OST, group, and overall atmosphere was something I really enjoyed. With Persona 5 Strikers coming, I was looking forward to catching up with the Phantom Thieves. Seeing the characters and the world yet again felt a burst of memories from the original title. This game mixes up its gameplay with introducing a more Dynasty Warriors feel (well, it's made by the developers). So the game is HEAVY on the mobs of enemies you face with each character having their own personal combos/moves to perform in combat. The \"Palace\" aspect for the dungeons has been changed (won't say for spoiler sake), but it's more or less the same format. \n\nComing up on my personal opinion of the game being halfway through, it's kinda... meh? It's not a bad thing in no way, but the game does tend to just be rinse and repeat constantly. Gameplay is good enough to continue playing, but the story just kinda wanes as it goes by. If you're someone who wanted to wait for a sale, I say do so. You're not gaining or losing anything from playing/not playing the game. It's just more Persona 5. If that's what you've been yearning for, you won't be disappointed in that regard. The OST is great as usual for a Persona game. My overall first impressions of everything are fairly solid. Regardless, if you played the original Persona 5/Royal and have missed the Phantom Thieves, then this is definitely that game to scratch that itch.",

        "content": "tl;dr 9/10\nfirst half of the game is monotonous and boring with uninspired dungeons that all play out the exact same, but the second half has more uniquely designed dungeons with enjoyable game play and writing that makes up for the weak first half. p5 cast is also just enjoyable as characters which is nice, and the combat is fun.\n\nPROS:\nthe combat is fun and blends JRPG and warriors style combat together incredibly well\n\nzenkichi hasegawa, sophia, kuon ichinose, and akira konoe were pretty well written and i liked them\n\nmost of the soundtrack is pretty good\n\nit gives characters who needed more development and screen time what they need\n\nthe writing of the cast was surprisingly fine for a spin off game i personally expected atlus to do the thing where they reduce characters personalities down to just two traits, but theyre pretty fine in p5s.\n\nMIXED: theres no real difficulty in this game, because of the way the jails are designed you can just enter and exit them with no penalty, meaning that loss of SP and HP are meaningless, combined with the fact that due to various upgrades you can end the game with ABSURD amounts of items that can give you much more upgraded healing & support than necessary. this isnt bad to me, as it can allows for more accessibility by default of being easier, but people expecting a challenge will have to go out of their way to make it harder (although i have heard merciless is actually pretty difficult, i have not started a merciless playthrough)\n\nsome songs on the soundtrack, although still good, sound more like generic video game music rather than the style p5s was going for, which left me dissapointed as the persona series never fails with its soundtracks.\n\nCONS:\nfirst half of the game. its monotonous and the plot is horribly sluggish.\n\nall of the dungeons felt the exact same in the first half which is never a good thing\n\nmost of the villains arent really anything good, which i dont mind the characters that are meant to be important are well written, but i wish theyd be atleast a bit more memorable or a bit more worth being someone im supposed to dislike, but its to be expected, the persona series has never been too good when it comes to any nonmajor villains.\n\nthe plot & villains are all just weaker p5, lots of the villains, just feel like weaker versions of the original. p5s's plot isnt even bad, its just that you know pretty much everything thats gonna happen the moment you realize that the story is just trying to copy its original.\n\noverall the game is good and the game is fun. thats what matters. id say around 90% of the time i had a smile on my face, even when in the early half when it did feel monotonous and unoriginal, the p5 cast and the combat always managed to make me have an enjoyable time, but its flaws are definetly existant, and noticable.",

        "content": "If you've played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal and enjoyed them, I highly (HIGHLY) recommend this game. However, neither of those games are on Steam right now which is super awkward for this review. \n\nEdit: Please don't be intimidated by my playtime. This game took me around 60 hours to beat because I did all the side content, other players report that roughly 40 hours are needed to mainline the game. My playtime is even higher because I accidentally left the game running in the background a lot.\n\nEdits: grammar and spelling\n\nI put over 130 hours into Persona 5, and around 170 hours into Persona 5 Royal. I love this series. For me, this game brings me back to Tokyo and reunites me with the main cast of the two games mentioned. It was like a reunion but with only your favourite friends. However, for a newcomer, this game won't make any sense. The history Joker (the protagonist) has with each of the characters is the foundation for almost all the dialogue. The plot pulls a lot of themes and refers to a lot of characters from Persona 5. Basically what I'm saying is: this game is not a great entry point for the Persona series.\n\nDespite all that, the game is amazingly fun despite the complete departure from turn based combat. While it can often be visually overwhelming, if you're willing put up with the chaos, you can have a lot of fun. The combat is admittedly button-mashy however each playable character (8 characters) has a short list of combos and special moves which each serve to give each character a unique way to play that makes them feel different. The fusion system is back (from the previous Persona games) which allows you to execute different Personas you collect and fuse them into stronger Personas, which you use to fight. The fusion system is very stripped down in terms of complexity and depth compared to P5 and even more so compared to P5R. However, it gets the job done. \n\nThe story is always the focus with this series, and it doesn't fall short compared to the other entries. While shorter than previous entries, it still emphasizes friendship, justice, and the importance of free will. Obviously I'm not going to spoil the plot, but like I said: If you enjoyed previous stories from the Persona franchise you will most likely enjoy this one. \n\nCriticisms: the game doesn't have a daily schedule like the previous games, there aren't any confidant/social link mechanics, the voice lines are very repetitive in the menus, the game very frequently drops frames when the screen gets too busy (I'm pretty sure this is an issue with any rig, not just mine), and there aren't any options for romance whatsoever (it's not needed for the story but it allows you get attached to the characters) except for mild flirting. None of these were deal breakers for me.\n\nTLDR: Play Persona 5 (even though Persona 5 Royal is superior in every way) up until you finish the casino palace (this is a lot to ask because that's halfway through a 100+ hour game) before you play this game. I recommend P5 instead of P5R because P5 is cheaper, it's even available on PS3, and it's free with the Playstation Plus collection if you're lucky enough to get a PS5. This game is amazing, but it's better enjoyed with the context of Persona 5.",

        "content": "At first I was a bit skeptical on how this game might play especailly being a fan of the other persona games, but hearing a lot of good reviews about it, and seeing some gameplay I decided to try out myself. So far I am really enjoying myself. I love how it does feel like a sequal to persona 5( Although I wish is was a sequal to Royal.) I love that the characters still have that charm and humor we all know and love. The story is interesting for the most part.\nThe two things that I'm still trying to get used to it the combat. I like it but I don't at the same time, since I'm so used to the turn based combat with this series, and not the hack and slash from the Warriors Series (Even though I do enjoy that series as well.) And the other is the change in the day cycle. It feels weird being able to leave the new meta-verse freely when I get low on HP and SP, and immediatly come back to continue where I left off, on the same day multiple times. Not bad per say, just a weird feeling.\nLastly, when it comes to problems like bug, glitches, or crashes. I've only finished the first dungeon right now, but haven't encountered any issues at the moment which is nice since so many new games nowadays has some type of issues.",

The game ends on credits with no other modes/co-op so there is little incentive to keep playing past hitting credits other than going for 100% (not even new game +). That is not to say there isn't meat in that story mode. Persona fans being fed well.\n",

        "content": "Don't buy this game if you haven't played through the original Persona 5 (vanilla, not Royal) which sadly isn't available on PC (legally at least...). If you did this game is much more than just a musou and I definitely recommend it.\n\nWhile it doesn't have social links and the calendar system this game is pretty much a sequel to Persona 5.\n\nAlmost all the elements from the original turn-based combat system are also present in the new real time combat of Strikers even if they work a bit differently. Affinities, skills, Persona fusion (obviously not to the same extent), the dungeon crawling; it's all there and it's fun!\n\nThe story doesn't only take place in Shibuya this time, it's a roadtrip across Japan and the changing scenery/locations constantly keep things interesting. The new characters are great, the music is fantastic as always. All the characters play differently with their own unique mechanics and due to the affinity system you need to pick the right party and persona loadout for Joker for the right bosses/encounters.\n\nThe story is decent, it starts out very solid but unfortunately runs out of steam close to the end. The pacing is all over the place. The last boss is [spoiler]pretty much the same as the one from vanilla Persona 5 (literally the same being if you know a bit about gnosticism...)[/spoiler], so I wasn't really paying much attention at the end anymore, it just felt like a repeat and the phantom thieves were saying very similar lines that didn't have much of an impact anymore.\n\nThe combat can get very tedious especially in the late game. Even on Normal difficulty some bosses and shadows will have very high HP pools while your party members can die in 2-3 hits. You spend alot of time just whittling away at their life until you manage to knock them down for an all out attack which maybe does like 10% of their HP. I understand they wanted the combat to be more strategic and focused on exploiting enemy weaknesses but at some point it just stops being fun. Especially when the party member AI occasionally has a brain fart and just lets bosses one shot them with highly telegraphed attacks.\n\nDespite all this I still had a very good time with Strikers and I think anyone who liked Persona 5 also will.",

The story is great, the added characters are great, and it's a fun road trip with these characters. My one complaint is that the gameplay style of a warriors game is a but annoying when doing person esc puzzles. Overall, it's good, play it if you want to.",

I prefer the main Persona game but if this is your thing. It certainly is a good game in comparison to Royal. I suppose I can't blame a specific reason, but it's not the same as the main line. Stuck on rails and missing the main feel of the game.",

        "content": "Really fun game took awhile to get use to the controls using a switch pro controller but enjoyed the game so much. The combat does require you to abuse the weaknesses of enemies as done in the original Persona franchise therefore at time MP usages can be draining during  a single run in the dungeons - so do keep in mind to find checkpoints and pop in and out of the dungeons to refresh the MCs MP and HP as well as switch party members. If your going to pick this up straight up spend as much time as you want in the cities you visit in the real world (in game) as there are things you might miss. Overall a great game with an always amazing sound track by Lyn, Lotus and the Atlus/ Toei did an amazing job!",

        "content": "The gameplay is pretty simple and easy to understand. HOWEVER, some significant flaws like aiming guns are broken as your crosshair moves up and down like an earthquake simply from moving it in either left or right directions.\n\nThe store is also watered down a tad as you used to be able to sell all your junk with a push of a button in persona 5. with strikers, you must sell each item individually as the \"sell all junk\" button does not exist anymore.\n\nEverything else gameplay-wise was fine from what I have seen except for some exploits due to how far you can jump to places, and in certain areas, if you look up, you can pass entier areas without going to the actual entrance, which I accidentally did and backtracked to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe story is..... how to put it..... probably the worst thing about this game. The removal of all the supporting members from the game and being left with just a few new ones hurt the story badly. The hub world feels empty because of this, as there is nothing to do or get more investment in the story (at least from what I saw from beating the first palace). \nThe story also feels completely unrelated to me, as the stakes for beating any of the palaces are super low. While in the first game, the cops in the story would have arrested you the moment you were suspicious, even at the last scene of the game. In this one, it feels like no one cares (except for one guy) despite you being a phantom thief. You actually had severe consequences in the story in the first one, but in this game, it's just a straight path with some little stumbles and no risk. Maybe it gets better after the first palace, but I didn't care to continue as it felt pointless. i could compare this to mementos side stories, but with extra flair. that's basically it.\n\nI'm sure some people love this stuff, and gameplay-wise, it's obviously not bad. But for me, this was just boring to continue, which is ironic considering this game has more action in it than persona 5.",

        "content": "This game is not perfect... However it comes very close! I picked up the digital deluxe edition and loved every second of it. In fact, I think the overall story was much better than the original P5 game. Don't get me wrong, I still love both stories but I think the Monarchs make so much better antagonists than the Palace Rulers. I love how this game took the idea of the Phantom Thieves and brought the question of how humanity acts and relies on free will and isolation. I felt like all of the Monarchs were in the position that they are purely because of how they fell off their paths in life instead of just being pure evil. This led to the change of hearts being much more believable and made me wonder how the Monarchs got to be the leaders of the jail every time I got to a new one and how we were going to save them. Overall, this game improves the concept of the Phantom Thieves and brings a brand new game play style that works together so well. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves good stories, good game play, or are just a fan of the Persona series in general.",

        "content": "I haven't played merciless/new game + yet but as of my base game experience so much fun, the gameplay is filled with flashy satisfying combos but many fights still require strategy and attention so it's such a perfect balance that it's addicting.  The writing is incredible as always and the characterization and interactions are arguably better than og persona 5 and royal.  The setting of the game as a summer roadtrip around Japan is genius and was a great breath of fresh air besides the familiar area of Shibuya.  The two main new characers Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions especially Zenkichi.  The visuals are also very pretty and refined especially the in-game cut scenes which honestly looked better than the anime cut scenes.  Overall I wanted more persona 5 and that's what this game gives you, exactly what I needed around this time.  The only complaints I have are the persona system with joker could be done a little better compared to previous p5 games, Lavenza and the velvet room in general should've been used in the plot a bit more or just change things up and make it more unique rather than \"Oh guess what you're a trickster of fate again\", and the plot near the end is pretty predictable and similar to P5R.  I can see why people don't like Sophia as well being the whole AI learns about the concepts of humanity thing but Sophia's interactions and expressions were very cute so it made up for it.  Every character gameplay wise is incredibly fun the best in my opinion being Makoto, Ryuji, and wolf(won't say who wolf is cuz spoilers) but the only complaint I have gameplay wise is Sophia, in a muso game I want to do big flashy moves or badass combos, with so much happening on the screen why would I want to practice timing perfect catches with a yoyo for sophia's combos how can I read her catches while watching every other enemy and dodging attacks, functionally her bless magic and healing are very helpful but that's all I really used her for her magic for bosses and mini bosses who were weak to bless or just healing team members she's the only character I found my self barely using in combat.\nOverall 9/10 very surprised and excited to do New Game +",

        "content": "Should you buy it? If you have played Persona 5 then yes, If you have played Persona 5 Royal, I don't think so, I personally think moving from Persona 5 Royal to Persona 5 Strikers is a downgrade but if you want to check out the new characters and some new generic persona 5 story, I am not stopping you. I will say that the new characters are the only ones worthwhile in this game. If you haven't played any Persona 5, then I don't recommend you buy it. The game is good enough to keep you entertain for sure but I doubt you're gonna spend a lot of time unless you're really a die-hard fan who has nothing to do. I do think it is a great game, but I do not think it is worth the price at the moment. I would say wait for the price to go down first. \n\n[h1]Good stuff[/h1]\n[u]New characters[/u]\nThe only reason you should play this game is to check out the 'new aigis' , 'new dojima and his daughter', and the new villains. My favourite villain would be Sapporo's Monarch just because it is kinda rare to see one of the main groups to have a good parent figure for once. The story on the other hand, it is fine but I really don't like they have a plenty of similarities with Persona 5, should've done more like Persona 5 Royal final boss did.\n[u]Music[/u]\nYea, I like Rock music.\n\n[h1]Mixed bag[/h1]\n[u]New combat[/u]\nThis is pretty much the selling point of the game, changing it from turn-based combat to action rpg. I really enjoy in about 28 hours, then I got bored. The combos are repetitive, some enemies just takes too many hits to kill ( esspecially the ones with no weaknesses ) and damn I hate grinding. They do give Arsene have skills up to like level 95, but he doesn't really have any special skills and leveling him up is such a hassle considering leveling up a lvl 40 arsene takes more experience than a regular demon that have base level around 38-42. And in order to gain access to demons with level 67 and above, you need to beat them, and they take too much hits unless you keep grinding. However, I appreciate that they took the time to make this new combat systems. Really hope they bring the system back to make a new Raidou Kuzunoha game or something else because I think Persona should stick to the turn-based combat.\n\n[h1]Bad stuff[/h1]\n[u]Phantom Thieves[/u]\nI know this is a welcome back to Persona 5 fans, but damn the phantom thieves are kinda boring. 'New aigis' and 'new dojima' carried the phantom thieves through the whole game in terms of character development. Give me something new to learn about their characters not bring back their previous problems and relate it to the current villain. Which is one of the reasons Yusuke and Haru are the only ones I kinda liked and enjoyed because Yusuke is a goofball but we actually got to see more of him being serious instead of talking about him being poor and I learned something new about Haru which is her relationship with the villain.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention some of the personas need to be fuse with a the early personas at certain level for example, King Frost - Lvl 40 Jack Frost + Lvl 40 Jack O' Lantern. Jack frost should be around level 20 when you get him, and Jack O Lantern is Level 8, So if you didnt level them up or dont have enough Persona points, it is gonna take some time to get some of the personas.",

Only complaint is that you can't do much in the overworld when you're not exploring Jails other than buy stuff, things like hang out with confidants and build your bonds like in the main game, but it makes up for that by adding in missions to do in the other Jails.",

        "content": "Wow, Just WOW.\n\nWhen I first heard of this, I kind of turned a blind eye to it thinking \"Pssh, A Musou Persona game? Not gonna work.\" \n\nThe more I looked into it, the more it started to grow on me. Ended up pre-ordering sometime in January. Got it 3 days early because of the Deluxe order. Wow.\n\nI am so glad I picked this up. I fell in love with the Persona series when I got to try out Persona 4. Dark, Gritty, comical and pretty real when it came to terms and understanding characters. Played the original and P4 Golden. Absolutely loved every aspect of the game. Saw it released on steam and bought it without even thinking. :)\n\nThen P5 was announced!\nPre-orderd the box set before the prices when to crap before release. Completely loved the game and finished it.\nPersona 5 Royal. . . . CRAP! got to get it! Started to replay the game with the extras and to experience the new section of the story. Got about 76 hours into the game and lost everything past the 16 hour mark after a brown out. Forgot to upload to PS plus. Also, long story short. PS4 Pro, No Internal harddrive. Modified external with 8tb Barracuda Pro. Every brownout/ loss of power wiped the drive. After that happened, 2 tb SSD with the 8tb in a usb3 case. Works fine now but added a 1000 UPS unit to it. Honestly haven't touched it since\n\nStrikers though, I was positively blown away by how well this worked. A Dynasty Warriors take on Persona is certainly refreshing way to spin off an already great game. All of the characters we know and love are spot on and the VA's reprized their rolls wonderfully{save for Joker}. Absolutely love Zenkichi and Sophia and the parts they play. The gameplay was fluid and fast paced when needed and the music from the original games and the reprized Musou variants plus their original takes work perfectly for the new style of gameplay. Even the subtle change in the music when you went into the sneak sections was a pleasing change. I wonder how many people caught onto that change when they played those parts.\n\nThe story played out very well and was a pretty good length. I was surprised that it totaled almost 33 hours without doing the extra mission. It is pretty engrossing if you ask me with all of the comical, stereotypical, and serious character building while keep the balance of surreal, light, and dark positions each and every character goes through and faces during each mission or challenge.\n\nAll in all. The Highlights about the games really to make this a great play Save for the few things that I have found that started to break the immersion of the game. First off, The VA's did a wonderful job playing their parts but I found that the sound balancing in the game started to break the game. I was finding out that alot of the music did not lower when the characters spoke and alot of time the Va's voice would start to blend or even be overpowered by the music. I heard this alot when Skull spoke his dialogue. He even had a few lines that were inaudible or something that was completely non-exhistant when he talked. The constant crashing when the game was first released, which thankfully, was fixed with the beta update they released a week or so later. But when I really started to see was the slowdown during gameplay or in full on battles. I was well above the Recommended when I was running it first on my I5 6500, OLOy DDR4 2666{Limited to 2400 because of processor}, and my 1060 GXT SSC card. I kept getting slowdowns when I had alot of effects going on in game with more than 6 enemies on screen. It was the worse when I made it to the underground \"sewer\" part of the first Prison. The section near the end of the \"sewer\" part where the water was on the floor at the end of the dungen.  Upgraded the Processor and motherboard while keeping my memory and Vid card. Ryzen 5 3600X. was the processor upgrade and the game played almost flawlessly. Even got better framerates that stayed constant 60FPS even in the final dungeon where there were up to 50+ enemies on the field. I also found it strange that there were side quest mini bosses that were incredibly hard when compared to the normal Bosses and End game boss. I died more on those side quest bosses then I did on the Main ones. Once you started to get up in levels, the enemies became to easy which made it hard to start to complete the Character quests and Move sets. Maybe I will mess with it soon in a harder difficulty mode to see if my current Mode playthrough was the reason.\n\nNow, my last quip was Joker. I guess they could not get the original VA? I mean, His voice was alot more gruff at certain points but they used alot of his Persona 5 voice clips. It was very off putting listening to him. Other than that. It was a great game and was very enjoyable to play. Now I'll just wait for any expansions or new unlockable to see in game. Heres Hoping. ;)\n\n",

        "content": "Aight This Review contains spoilers for Persona 5: Strikers and Persona 5: Royal so don't complain when i reveal Yusuke was the main villain the whole time\n\nOkay anyway I enjoyed this game but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for 60 big ones unless you are an avid Persona Stan or you really enjoy this kind of Game. First off is the fact that the game likes crashing a lot and it also has a few glitches which might force you to close, which really sucks when you spend 30 minutes on the final boss fight and it crashes the next cutscene and I have to fight the boss all over again.\n\nNext is the story in General: If you played Persona 5, then you know the story of Persona 5: Strikers. There are bad guys in these palace like jails and it's up to the Phantom Thieves to change their hearts and take back their desires. Of course there is actually a false god who has been secretly pulling the strings and manipulating everything. It feels like you are playing a watered down fanfiction rather than an actual sequel with how similar it is to the main story. The only unique part of the story being Sophia but even then her plot is barely touched until the very end.\n\nNext are the characters: The main cast is back but it doesn't feel like they are back. They all act like parodies of themselves, like someone saw one scene in Persona 5 and based their entire personality off it. While its charming at first listening to the cast talk and crack jokes, there is only so many times we can hear about Ryuji's food obsession or Makoto's fist of justice or Yusuke being poor. The villains are all forgettable, their backstory is paper thin and the game tries to make it seem like they are morally grey characters or arent truly evil, but they dont even keep this pattern up half the time. Some villains are complete assholes who murder their parents, while others are boring and barely even criminals, like the guy who wrote a bad book. It felt like there was an attempt to make a villain who is good, but uses the wrong method like Takuto Maruki from Royal, but they all fall short. Maruki worked so well because he was a good guy and actually was attempting to do good, even if his methods and ways were wrong. The villains that try to seem redeemable are all murders whose control other people to force them to do their bidding. Even the twist villain who everyone could see coming just felt dry, like they needed someone to explain why EMMA even became a god in the first place.\n\nGameplay: The game play seems fun at first, but it quickly gets old after a while, it is just beat up the enemy, move forward, wow another ambush, beat up the enemy, fight a 10 minute mini boss, fight a 30 minute boss. There is just too much combat that feels unrewarding and dry, The time outside of the metaverse feels empty, like a poor imitation of the main games open world. The time progression system is completely uselss, and there is little to do outside except shop for groceries so you can have more sp and complete side request which just waste more time. Every area felt the same with no uniqueness, every battle felt the same, learn the enemies weaknesses and spam the move that works. Unlike the main game, which had a lot of flair, each battle lacks anything close to the art style and flair of the main game as you see all the game has to offer in about and hour of game play. God bless anyone who didnt buy the Legacy music because I could not stand listening to the same three combat songs over and over again. \n\nOverall this game is not worth $60, maybe $40 but i wouldn't go any higher, just wait for a sale if you really want it, also atlus pls fix your game I want to go one cutscene without crashing pls",

        "content": "This game is practically Persona 5 Lite. Contains a lot from base Persona 5, except social links and a restricted free roam. Time does not pass in this game when you do any sort of action, but instead only passes through story. It does feel rather cheaply made at first, though, since you can't run while free roaming, and all but two non party confidants were completely removed from the game because of [strike] low budget [/strike] convenient reasons. However, it shouldn't take much time to adjust to this.\n\nThe only gripe I can give this game is the combat. It works, but it's not great. Be warned, you will be dropped from full HP to 0 in less than a second many times in this game, and that's the game's biggest issue. I don't think they realized just how strong enemy moves were, so when you have 7 of them doing the same move all at once, it packs one hell of a punch. The majority of persona moves are also rather useless. Really, I never once used a physical skill, and I only used a magic skill a hand full of times. The only worth while skills in this game are stat buffs/debuffs, heals, and passives. Everything else, including skills like concentrate and charge, are completely worthless. Also, anything that was meant to hit all targets in the base game is also completely useless. It just costs more SP with a wider area of affect. Normal trash enemies don't need any debuffs to fight. The only thing you should use debuffs on is for anything that has a health bar on the top of the screen, and since it's only one enemy, you can save double the SP for just using the smaller area of effect debuffs.\n\nOverall, it's Persona 5 through and through with the only major change being Action RPG combat. If you liked P5's story and characters, you'll like this, and appreciate it too.",

        "content": "I was a bit skeptical at first due to the whole Dynasty Warriors vibe (never really appealed to me), but after getting used to the combat, I can truly say I'm loving this game. I would NOT recommend it if you haven't played Persona 5 for two reasons: 1. The game is a sequel to P5 so you wont really get most of the references or relationships. And 2. PERSONA 5 IS AMAZING AND SHAME ON YOU FOR NOT PLAYING IT. All jokes aside, this game is really fun, once you get into the flow of combat, it is really enjoyable. It has all of the charm of P5 and P5R, I was itching for more Persona 5 after finishing Royal and this is a very nice change of pace while still tying beautifully into the original story.",

The story was awesome, really fun, though still pretty similar to the typical persona formula, so slightly predictable at times, but still well done and touching. It actually made me cry a couple times on some themes that really hit home for me. The music is dope, as always, and I liked the variety, cause hearing the same one over and over can get old fast. And I think hard mode is well balanced.\nSide Note: this is a sequel, so if you haven't played original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then I highly recommend playing one of those first, or watching someone's playthrough if you don't mind spoilers. Hopefully they'll make that available on PC soon for anyone without a PS4/5",

        "content": "TL;DR The only criteria you need to think about if you're considering playing is \"Did you like Persona 5?\" If the answer is yes, play this without question. I would NOT recommend this at all if you haven't played the original Persona 5, this builds up directly on top of Persona 5 and you'll feel lost if this is your first Persona game.\n\nI'd give this a 8.5/10, only because Persona 4 and 5 have set a very high standard, so obviously this cannot compete with that but you'll never feel like this was a low-effort cash grab. It's very much a good polished game worth your time and you shouldn't compare it to Persona 5 which had a wayyy longer development time and budget.\n\nWhile there are definitely some weak links, you'll never feel bad about it when you're playing, and I had as much a blast with this game as much as I did with the other main Persona titles. In fact, I actually prefer this action combat system over Persona's original turn-based combat. Any future Persona games using this sort of combat over turn-based combat would be a dream come true (sadly it won't happen but it's fun to think about)\n\nAgain, this is totally worth your money if you've played and liked the original Persona 5. I'm just sad it has ended and I'll have to wait a long time for another high-quality Persona game. I have very specific reasons for not giving it a perfect score but it's not for this review. I feel like there were some game design/level design issues and Sophia is an unlikable character for me personally. But then again, Persona games have always been cheesy, and all those issues won't really bother you when you're playing; they only seem worse in hindsight when you think about them afterwards.\n\nThank you Omega Force, P-Studio and Atlus for making this. I greatly enjoyed my time and now I feel like I'm in a void again now that this has ended.",

Most of the battles are fun but none get so challenging that you need to grind for hours on end. \n\nOne thing to note, I can't seem to launch or play this game full screen. I don't think it was made to be played on a keyboard so I'd recommend a controller. Since thats how I play I have to launch in bigpicture mode...which wants to launch the game in fullscreen. Sometimes just launching the game is...a struggle. so I mostly leave it open all day to save myself the headache.  I'd say go out and buy it...just not on steam.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers (or scramble if you're playing the JP version) is a fairly good ActionJRPG. HOWEVER, it has a very big problem of crashing, sometimes at the worst possible time (I have literally had crashes immediately after finishing a boss fight losing upwards of an hour of progress). I do still recommend the game to anyone wanting to dip their feet into the SMT/Persona series, though it does not only contain spoilers for the base Persona 5 game (takes place not too long after the end of Persona 5) and it also expects you to know the general gist of the plot of Persona 5 as well. Until a patch does come out addressing the stability issues though, I must say to save very frequently to avoid loss of progress. Game length wise is about 40 hours doing most of the side missions/Requests on Normal difficulty so you do get your money's worth, and New Game+ does exist if you feel like rerunning at higher difficulties.",

They did this game a huge amount of Justice, I honestly felt like crying when I beat the game, mainly because of the fact that the Visuals are extremely beautiful and you can relate to the Characters in most situations, and mostly because I didn't want it to End. ATLUS made an extremely phenomenal game that I hope gets nominated for the Game Awards and wins at least one Award, because it definitely deserves it.",

And the more open dungeon design and action-based combat will make playing the original feel a little cramped and dusty. Definitely play Persona 5 before playing this game though, as this is more of a summer vacation side-story experience and it really hinges on you knowing all these characters from the previous game. And for anyone worried about this being action-oriented instead of turn-based, don't worry. As someone who struggles with twitchy games, this one was pretty easy to play.",

This one felt so much more personal, like the voice actors had SO MUCH FUN playing these characters and adding their personal touch to it. I especially loved the new characters as well, especially Sophia. She made me tear up multiple times. My favorite team was the P4 Investigation Team, but this game really made me connect the Phantom Thieves so much more. \n\nNow moving to combat, combat feels GOOD. Much better than most other Musou games, as it certainly feels like Atlus/Sega really had their hands in this to feel like a Musou game, but kept the theme and fighting to still feel like a Persona game. All the Thieves had their own showtimes, combat arts, and everyone just felt different in all the right ways. \n\nLastly, the music BUMPS. Persona games have always nailed this, but GOTDAMN this game got the tunes perfect! Every city and the tunes that follow it work for the areas. Everything like coming into the jails, the song playing for the big moments like \"Daredevil\", the title song \"You are Stronger\" Much better than P5 originally, as some palaces didn't really have themes that fit them well. \n\nMy biggest complaint as of now, is the crashing. The game crashes a good amount during some loading screens. Wasn't enough to deter me from playing, since I save almost every time I go to the hideout, before I have to load to the next area, but I was very nervous during some cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, super fun game. I loved every minute of it, and it didn't super overstay its welcome like P5 did. P5R helped manage the time better, and this game, every moment felt impactful and kept me on my toes.\n\n10/10. Gonna miss the Phantom Thieves a bunch.",

        "content": "More Persona 5 is what I need in my life. And Atlus was happy to oblige. And that makes me happy.\n\nThis is probably a horrible place to start of with Persona. Go play P5 if you want to do that, then come back here. Or go play P4 on Steam if you don't have a Playstation. There are a lot of injokes and character specific stuff that'll woosh right past you if you haven't played P5 beforehand, and while the gameplay is pretty good, that's almost certainly not why most people want to play this. But if you have played P5, you know why you want to play this, and it will not disappoint.\n\nI'm surprised how well the Persona 5 style was integrated into the hack and slash genre. It really does feel like a Persona game first and a musou game second. Not to mention that it's on Steam and the port is even pretty good! The only other thing I really could ask for is this fitting with Royal better, since this really is a follow-up from P5 and not P5R, but given how Atlus chose to develop both of these games, that wasn't really doable. Real shame. But I'm not gonna complain, since things turned out pretty good.",

It is pretty much like the actual persona games where you go through the metaverse and battle dudes after another(like pokemon/dragon quest/persona LOL) even though it's not a turn based game. It feels more of an RPG game than a warriors game. There are times I feel like I am actually playing persona 5. I mean you still battle hordes of enemies but this game does the formula the best and I hope future warriors games follow this \"pattern\"",

When I first approached this game, I immediately assumed it was going to be the same musou experience like the Warriors games I've played in the past. The first 5 hours I was a little disappointed when its core game play and mechanics weren't exactly what I expected. But then I remembered that this is a sequel to the first game and treated as such while still in the mindset of musou player. After that, it changed my view for this entirely. Its music and plot made it even more enjoyable and the fact that each playable member is unique in its own right even it was straight to the point. This is definitely a must have for Persona fans and perhaps newcomers. I will give this a 8/10. If you're still iffy about getting it or not then wait for it when goes sale. Also don't get the ALL-OUT ATTACK PACK, it is not worth the money and you can easily get its in-game skills and items progressively. Aight yall be good people and WEAR YO MASK!",

        "content": "I recommend this game but it is more of a cautionary one.\n\n*Persona 5 Strikers is a sequel to the original Persona 5. It is not exactly a sequel to Persona 5 Royal \u2013 the expanded version released later. So Royal exclusive characters are not present in this game nor are the events of its third semester are covered. Persona 5 Strikers\u2019 release on Steam is admittedly rather strange considering that neither the original Persona 5 or the Royal version are not present on the platform, so new PC players are likely to be confused and would spoil the events of the original game.\n\nI have seen some players say that you do not need to play the original game but that is not true at all. It is highly recommended that you should play, at least, the original Persona 5 before Persona 5 Strikers either on PS4 or by waiting for a Steam release if that happens.*\n\nI really enjoyed the story of this sequel. Most Persona spin offs have rather tepid stories but this one pulls its weight above the others. The road trip setup is a great idea and it all helps solidify the fact that the Phantom Thieves are a close set of friends overall. It\u2019s also quite funny and entertaining overall. I also enjoyed the new characters \u2013 Zenkichi and Sophia \u2013 and thought they fitted in well with the story and the Phantom Thieves\u2019 road trip as well. But sightseeing is unfortunately limited and you feel like you\u2019re in the Metaverse more than the locations you visit. Additionally, whilst the bond system is competent and makes sense in the context of the story it cannot replace the freedom of the confidant system from the original game (returning players may be disappointed with the lack of returning side characters from P5 as well, although it would be a stretch to involve them in this story). The result is a far more linear, repetitive, and straightforward journey. (On a side note I found that some plot elements from previous games were repeating in P5 Strikers, not just jokes but also character backstories as well \u2013 quite distracting for those familiar with the main games and I hope that fresh plot details are explored for the next inevitable numbered sequel.)\n\nP5 Strikers\u2019 gameplay is designed to be like an arcade like experience. Within the Metaverse combat has been changed from turn based battles into Dynasty Warriors real time combat where you face many enemies at once. The change from turn based to real time combat works surprisingly well and fits naturally for a spin-off title. It can get repetitive and grindy but for the most part it was fun. Persona fusion also returns but it is scaled down in comparison to the original and does not have the depth previous seen in prior games. But it\u2019s all in service for this arcade gameplay and as I said previously it works well and it is fun to play. \n\nThe game also successfully adapts Persona 5's graphical style and music. The new music in this game is really good and effortlessly reaches the same standards of the original game and the Royal version.\n\nI never really had a major issue with any of the game\u2019s mechanics, story, or characters. But the most severe issues are the technical problems and the state of the port. Reviewers and posts on the Steam discussion page report have constantly reported the infinite loading screen and crashing bugs. I have experienced it as well. I was prevented from playing the game for about a week since it refused to load the main menu in full screen or borderless mode. Only opening the game in windowed mode worked but I got frame drops and it was not smooth. I only managed to get around these loading screen crashes when I saw a post on the Steam Discussion that recommended disabling the additional content that contained the behind the scenes and interviews for the game. Apparently there was an issue in the content that carried over into the main game that caused the severe crashing. After disabling it I managed to load the game and play it in a more stable state. Whoever that person was who recommended disabling that \u2013 may Philemon bless you because you saved my play through.\n\nHowever, that was not the end of my issues playing the game. Whilst I never experienced the boss crashes that prevent you from advancing I still experienced crashes when transitioning to a new area or whilst in a loading screen although it never repeats this behaviour constantly. I also experienced stuttering during the in-game and anime cut scenes but perhaps the most annoying bug I had experienced was the severe frame drops and the resolution glitch. Sometimes I would have severe unexplained frame drops despite being at the game\u2019s highest settings at 1080p for the majority of my play through. When I changed the settings and reset them the game looked more pixilated and blurry despite, again, being at high settings. It was a frustrating issue and I only managed to solve it by playing around with the render quality function which makes me think there is a bug associated with the option.\n\nI also experienced some inconsistent issues regarding the English voice acting as well. The English voice acting is rather good so there is no issue regarding the actors themselves. It\u2019s just some characters sound quiet against the background music and I had to change the sound settings just so that I can hear them. I had this problem more so with Yusuke and Zenkichi. This is an impact of the pandemic since these actors most likely worked at home where they probably did not have the best sound mixing equipment.\n\n(I should mention that some people may not have encountered any issues at all and that this experience is not universal for everyone.)\n\nThis port is a mess and desperately needs to be patched. But we are a month after release and Atlus have not released one \u2013 only a Beta Branch. After the initial issues regarding the PC ports of Catherine and Persona 4 Golden they cannot keep releasing games like this on Steam on day 1 and remain silent on official fixes until they happen, whether its future games or ports of older games. It\u2019s quite frustrating. It does not help that people begging for more Persona on Steam drown out the concerns made about the bugs and issues with the port.\n\nWhat we are left with is a game that is really fun to play with a stellar story and great additional characters that are welcome in the world of Persona 5. It is likely the best spin-off yet for the franchise. But at the same time my playthrough on PC was unstable and prone to technical problems. This is why I give Persona 5 Strikers a cautionary recommendation because the fun I had playing the game managed to outshine the quality of the port and I managed to look past it. Whilst I managed to play through the game, for those who want the game but haven\u2019t purchased it on Steam yet I would wait until it is patched and the main issues are resolved. I know it is bad to wait on a game to be patched when we all waited for over a year for this game to be localised into English, but hopefully it will be worth it.\n\n(This review may be changed or removed if a patch is released.)",

        "content": "I haven't met many people in recent years who hadn't heard of Persona 5 in some fashion. Whether it was someone who had played every persona game before, just P5, or had heard of it through an annoying Twitter fan or some other medium, it is clear P5 has made some kind of impact in the gaming world. I am someone who has played every game since the original, and I am not one to shy away from the fact that I'm someone who has enjoyed every one of the games I've played.\n\nWhen I finished P5, I remember being content with the game over all. There were characters I wished they had flushed out a bit more, story lines I felt were unnecessary, and some general annoyances; but overall, I enjoyed it a lot. When I heard that it was getting a direct sequel in the form of Strikers, I was actually pretty excited. I had expected them to do a \"Crimson\" version (which they ended up doing with Royal), similar to Persona 4 Golden or Persona 3 FES, so getting a fully new game centered as a direct sequel sounded like an awesome change of pace. When it initially came out only in Japan, with no plans for a western release, I was bummed, but I figured it would come to the states eventually. So I played Royal and waited, keeping myself away from spoilers.\n\nWhen I got the game in my hands, I knew nothing about it aside from the fact that it was not a traditional RPG style Persona game we've come to expect. It was a style more akin to the Dynasty Warriors games, and while I had dabbled a bit on the surface with Hyrule Warriors before, I wasn't sure what I would be getting into.\n\nI am now very close to having all the achievements and beating the game on merciless, so I can say I have delved into the game pretty deeply.\n\nThis game is amazing. \n\nIt is an amazing blend of RPG mechanics from Persona that makes for exciting battle flows and creative persona setups, and the Dynasty Warrior hack-and-slash game play. Unlike Hyrule Warriors, you don't fight onslaughts of baby AI enemies that can barely touch you. You fight mini battles, similarly to turn based games, getting an opportunity to strike while they're unaware, or falling victim to their attack on you. You are encouraged to constantly switch party members to get combo chains off with the baton pass and 1-More system that made Persona 5 so satisfying to battle with. It remains simple to learn Dynasty Warriors, hard to master Persona style the whole way. It's a refreshing take on battles that I enjoy so much, and hope to see more of if they continue to enjoy this partnership together.\n\nThe story is a continuation from the original, the gang is all back together, with some new people to boot, and while it feels slow at times, similarly to the original, the game makes up for that by placing you in charming settings and well crafted dungeons to explore. Each dungeon theme is unique, and the atmospheres they set are great, borderline some of the best the series offers. I enjoyed everyone in the game again, and it seemed as if the voice actors did as well - they really shine in this installment.\n\nMany game mechanics are streamlined compared to P5. There are no social links, you instead get BOND points you get through leveling up a BOND meter (doing anything from battling, to completing cutscenes/requests, and even little mini events in each town). You have one store you buy and sell everything through. Joker can make food that gives benefits to his party members in battle. Persona's retain their forgotten moves, and you can switch moves around any time outside of combat (a HUGE improvement over the original). Fusing personas has been drastically simplified, which does make it easier in some ways, harder in others. Your control over your persona's levels and stats are streamlined very effectively, making keeping useful persona's around for longer much more easy than the original.\n\nThe music in this game is very different from P5 in most ways. There are times when an original track plays, building off of that continuation piece of the game, but there are plenty of new tracks to listen and jam to. The new towns you'll travel to all have great tunes, and the dungeon themes are incredibly unique from the very first one to the last. You can tell there was an attempt to try to be a bit more flashy with the soundtrack in most cases, which makes sense as this is a flashy beat-em-up style RPG. There is an excited, determined energy that is clear and present throughout.\n\nSo, the final question, should you play Persona 5 Strikers? If you haven't played Persona 5 and you were hoping to start with this game, and are concerned about being confused plot-wise, I would say no. There's a lot of references that might fly over your head, and you could be lost at times (though the game does explain some of the more important backstory things you would need to have some idea of whats going on). If you have played P5, or you don't care about the plot too much and just want a fun RPG/slasher hybrid, then yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Most likely, this game isn't going to change your life like many people have claimed Persona games have before, but it will most definitely provide at least 40+ hours of quality music, fantastic combat and gameplay, decent plot, funny moments between a group of close friends, and a game that will have you wanting more. And who knows, maybe this game will inspire you to play the other ones for the first time, or the tenth time, and that'd be a pretty great outcome too.\n\nWell done, Atlus. Well done, Omega Force.",

Only tip I would have is beat Persona 5 (Atlus, PC port PLS) before playing P5 Strikers, this game leans pretty heavily on Persona 5's themes, story and characters, so it can be tough to understand some of the story's depth without it.\n\nPros-\n- Great persona combat systems woven into Dynasty-Warriors style gameplay makes for a completely unique experience. Action-based persona combat is crazy fun.\n- Easy to run - not super demanding but strangely doesn't perform well at native 4K on a 2080ti, but that might be a me thing\n- Classic super deep persona story, shorter but not in a bad way. Easily 40-60 hours for someone experienced in the genres, more if you're not.\n- Plenty of additional challenges like Merciless difficulty on NG+, tougher boss fights and others to keep me coming back for more.\n\nCons-\n- No Ultrawide Support - I can forgive this for Persona 4 golden since it's a port of an older Vita game, but this game is new, come on.\n- Locked to either 30 or 60fps - again, modern games shouldn't have hard FPS caps.\n- Depth of the combat system can make things unforgiving for newer players - allowing for tweaking of individual parts of the game's difficulty like Persona 4 Golden has would go a long way for some players.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a great sequel to the original Persona 5 but does not quite match the sheer magnitude of perfection that its predecessor has. I also can't recommend that you buy this game unless you have played the original Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal because it is a direct sequel and it makes no effort to catch the player up to speed.\n\n\nPersona 5 Strikers' new characters (Zenkichi and Sophia) fit seamlessly into the original cast, both of these new additions bring something new to the table, invoking both memorable dialogue and continuities that tie the main story together. The main story of Persona 5 Strikers follows up on Vanilla P5, it takes place during the summer after the main protagonist returns to his hometown and he makes a return to Yongen-Jaya to meet up with his old friends, aiming to do something fun for the summer. Unfortunately, this time of tranquility only lasts for so long until they meet their new conflict, which I'll leave you to discover.\n\nIt's combat is both addicting and intriguing, drawing the player in with immense strategy and its upbeat persona-esque music engaging its player. It's entirely different from P5's turn based combat but retains its strategy in exploiting weaknesses and debuffing your enemies. \n\nThe only problems I have with P5S is that the dungeons sometimes force fights on you, and it's incredibly difficult to manage SP. Also, I think I had somewhere around 4-5 crashes along my playthrough, so it's important to save often. All in all, P5S is a great game and is most definitely worth checking out.",

        "content": "Do you like beating up hordes of faceless goons in a nightmare world created by the twisted perspectives of highly insecure people? If so, Persona 5 Strikers is the game for you.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about the Persona series in general, or Persona 5 in particular, to enjoy Strikers. P5S is a musou-style beat-em-up/hack-and-slash free-for-all, so if you've ever played any of the Warriors games (Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Hyrule Warriors, Fire Emblem Warriors), you know exactly what this is. That's not to say it's bad; in fact, just the opposite. P5S had me smiling from start to finish because it was simply fun, a thing I had long forgotten video games could be. In a world full of roguelikes, open-world sandboxes, MMORPGs, and JRPGs, the Warriors games simply put you in a room with a hundred bad guys and let you mow them down with manic energy. If that's the sort of thing you find gratifying, you'll like P5S.\n\nThis game is set not too long after the events of Persona 5. The band gets back together for a wild summer tour of Japan, but their plans are interrupted when hearts start changing without any apparent cause. The authorities blame the Phantom Thieves, who are forced to investigate and clear their name. Along the way, they encounter a Lewis Carroll enthusiast, have a classic mix-up in a Japanese hot spring, meet a living AI, bury a cop in sand, nearly get pummeled to death by brainwashed islanders, and fight a giant...um...phallus in a chariot (I'm not even kidding).\n\nIn true Persona style, every fight is a bombastic and flashy beatdown. Whereas other musou games do not penalize direct approaches, P5S rewards you for ambushing enemies and getting in opening hits while traversing dungeons. P5S not only draws on the Warriors franchise for inspiration, but also feels at times like the investigation parts of Ace Attorney and the stealth parts of Metal Gear Solid, while bosses and their dungeons often feel inspired by NiGHTS into Dreams. Using the eponymous personas adds a Pokemon-style RPG element as you swap party members and their personas in and out to maximize attack effectiveness. It's a lot of fun and there's a lot of replay value, especially since the game rewards you for revisiting places you've already been to for additional bonuses. The soundtrack is continuously popping off with jazzy, funky melodies during fights that encourage you to do everything from blow party poppers in your enemies' faces to skateboarding into them at high speed.\n\nIf Strikers is the swan song for Persona 5, then it could not have hit a much higher note. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you like the over-the-top antics of any Warriors game and you've been wondering who that one character from Smash Ultimate is, then Persona 5 Strikers will take your heart.",

        "content": "[h1] TLDR; Poor PC port that crashes and fails to utilize SSDs, hilariously bad/lazy writing (if you disliked P5's writing, this is worse), and satisfying-but-boring battle gameplay. [/h1]\n\n[b] Fair Warning [/b]: My playtime does not reflect the length of this game, and I have not finished it due to being utterly frustrated with my aforementioned issues.\n\nWhen this got announced for PC, I was pretty excited to get some more breadcrumbs of Persona on the platform, even if it were just a Warriors-style spinoff. However, the final product given has left a LOT to be desired.\n\nThe first thing you may notice, at least if you have the game installed on an SSD, is the straight up abysmal bootup and loading times. Like, at least couple MINUTES to load into the intro screens. This game is definitely not as demanding as the original P5, and that game takes no effort to load on a disk drive for a console that's already out the door. On top of that, the game will constantly freeze and crash on loading screens. I've had 4 crashes in 24 hours, and 2 of those came on the same exact loading screen. The devs, however, do have a beta branch out as of this writing in the hopes of diagnosing and fixing these crashes.\n\nThe second thing you may notice, is how the writing in this release is just straight up not good. Some characters fall further into their awful stereotypes set in the original game (Ryuji & Ann are Dumb & Dumber, Makoto is even more bland, etc.). The two new characters to the group are just straight up depth-less copies of previous Persona franchise characters ( [spoiler] Sophia is super cute but seems to have the same character conflict as Aigis from P3, and Zenkichi has an eerily similar backstory and conflict as Dojima from P4 [/spoiler] ). There's even a bathhouse scene taken straight from Persona 3, except with the interesting bits removed and replaced with a generic slapstick punchline. Some positives to point out, though: the slice-of-life moments in this game feels just as heartwarming as the original game, Morgana is much less annoying, and Haru has way much more character and plays a bigger role in this game than she ever did before.\n\nThe third thing you may notice, the battle gameplay in this game feels confusing at first, but actually feels really clean and satisfying once you grasp it! However that quickly goes away once you realize the gameplay is just: travel to this place, battle a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, defend Futaba against a crowd of enemies, travel to this place, battle a boss and a crowd of enemies to complete part of the level. Repeat about three times and that's an entire arc of this game in the simplest terms possible. The battle gameplay is honestly not that frustrating (except: [spoiler] the massively disappointing Shadow Joker boss battle with an outrageous change in normal gameplay that honestly feels like a dumb gimmick rather than a difficulty spike [/spoiler]). If you enjoy Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, you probably won't have any problems here.\n\nAll in all, this is a ridiculously disappointing game. It's clunky/broken at times, cringey even for Persona standards, and just boring, confusing, and frustrating overall. At least the game's performance problems are in the process of being fixed.",

        "content": "Tl;dr: Great game, not just a Musou clone, well worth checking out.\n\nA worthy successor to Persona 5 and highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the original.\n\nRight out the gate, it's important to note that this is a rather different game to Persona 5 in a number of ways. The most obvious difference of course is the combat, but it isn't the only one by any means. The game lacks the free time aspect and confidants/social links that have become synonymous with the mainline Persona games, though this is likely not much of a surprise to anyone familiar with Persona spin-off titles. The pacing of the story is also quite a bit quicker than the mainline games, with the length of the main story coming in at around 35-40 hours depending on how much time a player spends doing side-content. And unlike the mainline titles, Strikers actually has a proper post-game state with some additional challenges to take on.\n\nOn the flipside, Strikers also has a number of similarities to Persona 5, most notably in the story itself. It becomes apparent early on in the game that the story is going to tread a lot of the same ground as Persona 5. It feels more focused and honestly hits the themes of the game better than Persona 5's story does, but at the same time is hindered by this re-tread - it feels almost as if the writers weren't happy with how P5 turned out in the end and wanted to do it over again. It isn't JUST a re-tread, of course, but anyone who has played Persona 5 Royal will notice a lot of the same new ideas present. To that end, both Strikers and Royal as a whole come together to make what feels like a platform for the developers to move forward with. This repetition in story elements can cause a few eye rolls at times, but if it means that any future titles can step out of the shadow of P5 and progress the plot further, then perhaps it was a worthy sacrifice. There are also a number of plot points that neither P5 nor P5R have done before, and these go a long way in making the game feel like a fresh experience.\n\nNow it's time to touch on what's probably the biggest elephant in the room - Omega Force's involvement in the development of the game. I know many players might worry a little when seeing that logo, as the Musou/Warriors combat style is notoriously repetitive and not particularly suited to a 40 hour RPG, and I was certainly amongst those wary when I first picked up the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised by just how fun it was, as the game blends both the Musou combat and Persona 5's combat incredibly well. You have access to all of the Phantom Thieves pretty much right from the get-go, and they all have their own attack strings and gimmicks - this isn't anything especially new for a Musou game, of course. What is new, however, is the way Personas are handled, elemental weaknesses, status effects and technical attacks, One More and All-Out Attacks, switching your player character mid-battle and containing fights to smaller areas rather than making the whole map one mass of enemies. \n\nAll of these elements from Persona 5 combined with the variety in gameplay styles come together to create a really enjoyable action-RPG. There are, of course, still moments where you'll be cutting through swathes of enemies, but as the game progresses, tougher enemies that you can't just blindly button mash against become more and more prevalent. You'll find yourself having to use the various Persona 5 systems more frequently, and as the enemies evolve, so too do your playable characters, learning 'Master Arts' which give them new follow-up opportunities or effects to their attacks, and abilities such as Avenger which performs a counter-attack when you evade at the last moment, rewarding skilful play. There are still a few times even late in the game where a battle will be over in a flash by ambushing the enemy, but at that stage it feels almost more like a reward for your progress than a nuisance. The game shines especially well in boss battles, where you'll be dodging enemy attack patterns while using the environment to your advantage and gradually whittling the boss down through their weaknesses - because unlike one of the more frustrating things about mainline series, bosses actually do have elemental weaknesses to exploit and are mostly vulnerable to status effects.\n\nThe developers also absolutely NAILED the presentation of the game - it absolutely feels like an extension of Persona 5, with all the style you'd expect. Though you don't have free time, the game still keeps track of the days over the Summer vacation and the environments all feel right at home. These smaller touches really help to sell the game as a sequel to Persona 5, and you could absolutely convince most people that it's part of the same game at a glance whenever you're not in a dungeon. You gain Bond Exp with the Phantom Thieves that you can turn into buffs and this helps to fill the same kind of thematic idea left behind by Confidants. There are also scenes between many dungeons where you just get to hang out with the characters and get to know them a little more with a fun event, similar to the original game. The new music is absolutely top notch, feeling at home with the rest of the soundtrack while also kicking it up a gear to match the more frantic nature of the combat.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic experience and one I think any fans of Persona 5 should try. It can feel a little slow around the 3rd dungeon at times, but it really picks up the pacing again after that and then never really stops moving until the game ends. As far as technical performance, it ran *mostly* smoothly for me, but a word of caution: switching out of the game window on a loading screen can sometimes cause it to hiccup and load forever. I did have this happen once or twice, but as long as you don't switch window during a loading screen, it runs just fine.\n\nHighly recommended.",

Took all her weaknesses into Battle, was dodging everything and STILL got one shot with level 15 and 16 characters. Had to turn it down to easy and ONLY THEN was the fight achievable. \n\nI don't recommend this for casual players or people that think they might want it because they want to dip their toe into the Persona series. \n\nThis game also reeks of poor design and can get REALLY tedious at times. I spent an entire 5 MINUTES in a dialogue after leaving an area, only to enter another, walk LITERALLY one step and then enter into ANOTHER dialogue with a mini-boss and then dialogue after that for another minute. This game really tries to make it hard to be refunded since they waste so much of your time in dialogues and back and forth walking simulators for no other purpose other than \"because we can make you\".",

Many have complained that there are no social links / confidant levels, but I find the Bond mechanic to be perfectly simplified for the type of game this is.

        "content": "This isn't P5S despite the name. This is Persona 5 - 2. Despite the change in gameplay style it's really just a follow up to P5 in both story and scope. It's a great excuse to have some more fun with the lovable cast of P5 this time on PC. Honestly, Despite what was said by the devs, I don't think this is too much fun for most people who haven't played the original P5 or Royal. Consider playing P5 before this to really get the most out of it. PS3's are pretty cheap nowadays, and if not it's pretty stable on RPCS3 *wink*. If you've played P5, It's an easy 10/10. If not please play P5 and then come here. If there's really no way for you to play P5 then maybe hold out for a sale cause the combat's still fun but honestly this game is more fun if you already love the cast. It goes down to like a 6/10 if you don't know the cast and past events. It doesn't spoil anything from P5 too big and you can still switch up the order but it's not recommended.\nUnlike this game. For me it's one of the few bright spots of this whole lockdown and an easy recommendation.",

        "content": "I'm impressed at how well they were able to implement the style of persona from an action jrpg into a hack and slash, especially since this is the series' first dive into the genre. Characters are consistent with their portrayals in base p5, though it stands to note that this game follows a story where persona 5 royal never happened. This game absolutely lives up to the legacy of the series, and the new characters I really enjoyed. Music was incredible, definitely enough to stand on its own. Setting was incredible. Plot progression was incredible. If anything at all, I feel like the writing in this game did feel a little on the nose and cheesy at times, but not at all enough to affect my overall opinion.\n\n[h1]SPOILERS [/h1]\n[spoiler]The final boss was easy. Like, really easy. Throughout my entire playthrough, I pretty much exclusively stuck with Joker (for obvious reasons), Haru (for heat riser and the fact that killing enemies with her rocket launcher was funny), Sophia (because she had a great moveset), and Yusuke (though I switched him out with Zenkichi during the Kyoto jail). While they were hovering in the mid level 70s by the final boss, my other team members ended under level 60. When you had to split up and fight the meatballs on the towers, I had no trouble spamming their moves and made it out without a single person dying. Even when you get all the meatballs and Joker has to kill EMMA, I just spammed Maeigaon and killed it without taking any damage. Honestly the Archangel in the room right before EMMA was more challenging in my opinion. The hardest boss of the entire game was Shadow Joker, and that's only because you do such little damage to him. I only got out of that boss fight by spamming health and sp healing items and wailing on him for a solid 10 minutes. Finally, I want to bring attention to Zenkichi. He absolutely stole the show in the entire game. There was so much passion that went into his performance, and, when paired with the writing of his character, made him the best part of the entire game. Also, as a temporary musical nerd, seeing Valjean appear in the awakening scene was an out of body popoff experience. The portrayal of Valjean as a persona was perfect (it even had the 24601 on his chest). But seeing Valjean specifically as the persona of Zenkichi was the most incredible thing because Valjean fits so perfectly with Zenkichi's character. AND it drew the parallel of Akane being Zenkichi's Claudette like oh my god that was absolutely genius.[/spoiler]\n\nHonestly, it's astounding to me what they were able to accomplish with this game, and it absolutely gave me the same feeling of unending emptiness of the mainline persona games when it ended (which is crazy because no social links and also half the playtime wow).",

        "content": "This is my first game from the Persona-series. I have watched a bit of Persona 5, but that was it. I also haven't watched any content to P5Strikers, or better, P5Scramble. This is why I was surprised that it was a Hack-n-slash game, however, it works really well with the setting. And the story, oh boy, good characters, good plot and overall a great experience. Every character has its onw playstyle, be it the allrounder Joker who has really save moves, Ryuji who has massive burst-options that leave him wide open for attacks or Makoto or Morgana who specialize in buffing and healing their teammates. If you like the Persone-style and look for a good hack-n-slash, play this, it's like a 40-hour game and worth every single cent. The only downside to this game is its instability, it sometime crashes, not often, but often enough for you to start saving all the time, however, you can't save during cutscenes or textboxes, you have to wait till cutscenes are over and just pray. If there is a hot-fix, ill give it a perfect score of 10/10, but till now it is a 9.5/10.\nMusic is, as expected from the Persona-games, great. I can't choose between \"Life will change\", \"Aria of the soul\" and \"Anti-HERO\".",

They are different in terms of gameplay and I would say that Strikers is much easier but nevertheless it delivers and touches.... The only usual thing of Persona series that kinda dissapoints me is their endings which are usually bittersweet and leave you with emptiness and need for a hug :)\n\nI should add that one thing that an asian (japanese in particular) cuisine foodie should be prepared for getting really hungry periodically while playing, 'cos the characters like to eat different stuff and discuss it in a very appetizing manner :)",

        "content": "Interesting experience for fans of dynasty warrior type games, disappointing experience for a persona fan. Graphics for the game even on the max graphics settings are OK at best. The models in persona 5 are so much more crisp while the models in persona 5 strikers are blurry and hard to look at when far away. After playing persona 5, I have to admit that the characters have gotten stale for me. All of the arcs that the characters went through in persona 5 are pretty much just reused in this game, making it seem very lazy to say the least. A character that really grinds my gears is Sophia. Her character development is pretty much a sh*tty version of a certain someones character development in persona 3. No social links is also a real bummer. It was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed persona 5 and without them the game really feels like its missing something. Another thing I would like to point out is the fact that they make you go back into the real world and sit through two loading screens just to recover your SP. And its not like there's any incentive to go back to the real world. There's no social links, the day doesn't change, and the area your in remains exactly the same until you manage to drag yourself through the jail. Every time you try to do a persona attack it freezes time disrupting any natural flow the game could have had. As for the soundtrack, there's a few soundtracks I like and a few that are pretty terrible. The soundtrack I found most enjoyable was the soundtrack to the first jail, Love te Wonderland. Otherwise, it mostly goes downhill from there. Overall, the games not terrible and may be enjoyable to fans of the hack and slash genre, but to everyone else I wouldn't recommend it.",

        "content": "Same great cast from the base game. Fairly engaging plot of a decent length. The new characters are all fantastic. As usual from P5 the presentation in terms of audio and voice acting as well as the visual presentation is crisp and to an really high standard. \n\nThe gameplay is that of a warriors game though with the RPG elements of persona fitting in in a really natural way. If you don't like the gameplay of other warriors games then you probably wont enjoy this one, though if you want more of the P5 cast and story then i can still recommend playing on easy mode and it may surprise you.\n\nI can make that recommendation since this is one of the best warriors style games out there. All of the characters are fun to play and the combat is so satisfying, it tones down a lot of the warriors series main features to allow for the new content but that rounds off the experience really well to make for a game thats just fun to play.\n\nTLDR\n\nIf you liked the base P5 or are a fan of good warriors games then give this a go. If you don't like the genre then perhaps its worth skipping. But everything this game does it does really well.",

        "content": "Despite being a much shorter game than your typical Persona game, Strikers still manages to tell a very compelling story that allows for characters to shine and really let their personalities steal the show. Once I started playing, I'll admit a part of me wasn't totally sold on the concept as a whole yet. I had never played a Musuo/Dynasty Warriors game before but knew that I had to see what the next chapter for the Phantom Thieves had in store for us. Sure enough, the further I progressed, the more the game grew on me and the more I bought into the transition Persona 5 went through to become a game like this. In reality, the essence of what makes Persona 5 such a compelling and lovable game was really what shined through in the end. The cast was full of life, love, fantastic personalities and unforgettable moments. Every character had moments that really let them take center stage and remind us all of what it means to overcome our own struggles and once again stand up on our own two feet. Personally, I wan't to give a special shout out to Haru, who was the final character to join the team in Persona 5. One of the things I wished we had in P5 was more time to spend with Haru and more opportunities for her to shine and that is exactly was Strikers gives us. This goes for all characters as well. I enjoyed getting to tag along with the Phantom Thieves for another journey through the human heart that resulted in some strong and powerful character moments that empowered the story to really hit home for myself and I'm sure for plenty of people, especially after everything we've been through and are still going through with COVID. It's crazy to think how towards the beginning of the pandemic we were graced with Persona 5 Royal and now a year later, we're given a worthwhile next chapter for the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. A few things to touch on before wrapping this up.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\nThe entire Persona series is known for its exceptional soundtracks and Strikers is no slouch in that department. Whether its the remixes of classic P5 tunes or the newcomers to the party making you stop what you're doing and groove in your chair, this game has no shortage of tunes for all manor of situations to aid you in your Phantom Thief duties! I plan on adding this soundtrack to my collection of Persona tunes that I already listen to on a daily basis.\n\n[h1] Crashes [/h1]\nThroughout my roughly 45 hours of game time, I had 3 total crashes happen while playing on PC. Thankfully, none of these crashes happened at crucial moments but it is something I've seen people write about in other reviews so make sure to save as often as possible!\n\n[h1] Story Continuation from Persona 5 [/h1]\nWhile ultimately not super important for the overall story, this game definitely assumes that you have played P5 before and are familiar with it's story so be mindful if you haven't played P5 before and are considering getting this game!\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\nAny opportunity to team back up with the Phantom Thieves is easily one worth taking and Strikers does a great job delivering on a worthy sequel to what was already my favorite game of all time. Hopefully the overwhelming amount of positive feedback will encourage Atlus to keep releasing Persona games on steam since its clear that the Phandom, old and new, are eager for more! P5 fans will adore this game but ultimately, any fans of good storytelling and meaningful character development will fall in love just as easily! Thanks for everything, Phantom Thieves <3",

        "content": "It's quite excellent.\n\nIf you really enjoyed Persona 5, you probably already picked this up.  If you haven't yet, definitely do so, it's an excellent follow-up.\n\nThe story, characters, Persona Fusing, weakness-exploiting, all of it feels like an excellent continuation from Persona 5, just wapped up in an Action Game format instead of a turn-based JRPG, while ALSO giving you ways to pause the action (summoning personas and pulling out the guns) to assess the situation and respond thoughtfully.\n\nDespite the marketing and the combo system, this is NOT a Warriors/Musou game.  It may use the basic button combo system from one, but it's far more deliberate.  There are very few enemy hordes, with most encounters being small gangs of enemies that are mostly all a threat (even the mooks).\n\nFinally, I like that once the lengthy tutorial is over, the game TRUSTS the player.  You get a huge party of 8, with all their combos unlocked the minute you enter the first dungeon for real, with all further unlocks either being powerups, or critical game-changing abilities.  There's very little unlocking required to access your core essential abilities and you can start doing cool and awesome stuff from the word go.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is the 2nd Persona game to make it onto the Steam store and is the sequel to Persona 5.  It brings with it a compelling story, engaging combat and amazing music.  While technically a musou game, the game plays very much like a Persona game in most respects.  The majority of this review compares the differences between this game and Persona 5 and Musou games to give you a good sense of what you are getting yourself into.  \n\n[h1] Whats Changed [/h1]\n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nCombat is by far the biggest difference between Persona 5 in this game.  The Combat has changed from a Turn Based System to an Active Time System, though it executes this spectacularly.  All of the iconic features of Persona are still present in this new combat system such as Weakness exploitation, All Out Attacks, and Stat/Ailment effects.  You also initiate combat just like you would in any other Persona game, by attacking an enemy on the field which sends you into a real time battle on the map.  \n\nWhile this is labeled as a Musou game, the only thing it really has in common with them is the number of enemies present on the screen usually consisting of a large number of trash mobs and a few enemies that actually pose a threat.  In addition, since it is Real Time, enemy attacks are now telegraphed and nearly all attacks are preventable by dodging out of the way or interrupting the enemy.  While this might be a bit hard to execute in trash mob fights with tons of enemies, this really shines in boss fights where there is one major threat to focus on.  \n\nOverall, this new Combat System is intertwined excellently with the Persona series, making you wonder why they have never done this before.  \n\n[b] Confidant System [/b]\n\nThe next big difference between this game and Persona 5 is the Confidant System, which was replaced with Bond Levels.  Unfortunately, this new system is quite limited as a whole, as it comprises only of party member interaction and lacks any NPCs to interact with and gain confidant levels with.  In addition, the time management system is all but gone as a result.  However, this new system still allows you to gain the benefits of the Confidant System by giving you Bond Exp with interactions, which you can use to buy perks very similar to what you would gain from Confidants.  \n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n \n[b] Story [/b]\n\nThe story is compelling as ever and while not quite as good as the main Persona series, still holds its own quite well, especially for a Musou game which typically don't have great stories. \n\n[b] Music [/b]\n\nThe Music remains a strong point of the game and the series as a whole, with a number of remixed pieces from Persona 5 as well as plenty of new additions.  \n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\n[b] Crashes [/b]\n\nIn 50 hours of this game, I've had the game crash 5 times.  Each of these crashes occurred at either entering or exiting a dungeon, so often not much progress was lost.  However, since this game does not auto save, you have to be careful to save often to prevent losing significant progress.  \n\n[b] Lack of Prequel Explanation [/b] \n\nThis game absolutely expects you to have played Persona 5 prior to playing this game, as there is little explanation of character's backstories or prior events.  Often times, the game references major plot points of the previous game but does nothing to even mention what happened, leaving people who haven't played the previous game confused.  While normally not too much of a problem, it is not even possible to play Persona 5 on Steam as of this review.  \n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is an extremely strong spinoff of Persona 5 with compelling gameplay and story.  However, it lacks some of the major features that some Persona fans love so much and also requires you to have played the first game in order to properly enjoy the story.",

True, it's different than regular persona games, but still the same.\nit got some features that actually even better than what's in regular persona game, u will miss some stuff, but u will enjoy what's in here.\nthe game is 50~70 hours depending on how u want to play the game, side quest isn't bad at all.\nthe story itself is really interesting and pretty solid.\n\noverall rating? dunno, but it's above 8/10",

        "content": "Great gameplay, awful writing. The dialogue is really uninspired and just seems like it was thrown at the wall to see what sticks. There's no real character or moral development from Persona 5, just more of the same. Our main heroes act like they've never had any life experiences outside of what the game shows you, as if they're just actors in a show. Regardless, the game is fun, I just find myself cringing at the rather second-rate plot points and superficial character development.\n\nEDIT: After completing the game, and likely going on to 100% it, I'll change my review to recommend. The writing and storytelling is still quite sub-par, but the gameplay is still exponentially fun, even as a musou-style.",

        "content": "Let me first say: IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED YET PERSONA 5 OR PERSONA 5 ROYAL, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, THIS IS A DIRECT SEQUEL TO THOSE GAMES. \nIt\u00b4s very hard for me to make a objectively review of this game because Persona 5 Royal is my N\u00b0 1 favorite game of all time. When I first listened that we were going to have a new Persona experience with a new battle system which replace the turn based combat, it was really exciting news, but I also thought that it was going to be just a musou/warriors game with a persona art style, and hoo boy how I was wrong about that assumption.\n From the music to the art style,  and to the story and the combat, it really felt like a Persona 5 game. The implementation of some of the previous games combat system mechanics to this new musou/warriors style combat fitted perfectly. Each of the phantom thieves combat skills are unique and different from each other. About the music, they never cease to amaze me. Each of the music tracks are phenomenal and outstanding. If they release a Persona 5 Farming Simulation game with new music like this and the previous games, I\u00b4ll keep giving them my money.\n The visual novel story part is still in this game and very well adapted, and although the social link aspect of the previous game is replaced with this new bond level system, I think it adapts really well to the format of this game. The story and new characters in my opinion are very well written, and it is really easy to attach to them, as usual.\n If I had to criticize something, perhaps it would be that some of the characters from the previous game are not in this one, either way, the main roaster is here. \nTo conclude, if you have previously played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, definitely you have to play this game without any doubt. I repeat, if you have not played those games, then go play them first. THIS IS A SEQUEL. Let\u00b4s pray that Atlus release Persona 5 Royal and the other Persona games on Steam soon.\nLooking cool Joker.",

If you liked Persona 5, you'll like this too because it's essentially more P5. Stylish, fun team interactions, great music, a decent story (especially for a spin-off), and just the all-around polish that I've come to expect. My main takeaway from this and the fact that the SMT Nocturne Remaster is coming to Steam (announced yesterday as of writing this) is that Atlus is on PC to stay, and that's what I really love about this. These games coming to PC means that P4G made them realize they can print money by giving games to people on the platform they want, and I'm all for it.",

        "content": "the games uhhhhh, fine? but not worth the price at all if you cut out padding.\ni'd describe it as one of those DBZ games, where its kinda garbage but theres enough there to satisfy you.\n\nthey tried to do more than just Persona 5 Warriors and it works out on a surface level, but when you get down to the nitty gritty aspects of the game it feels stretched out extremely far and much less inspired (in some points just being unfinished too)\n\nSPOILERS:\n[spoiler]The 2nd \"Jail\" is a parody of lazy writing in fiction, the problem is thats all it is, theres no story to it other than a single joke that runs its course 5 minutes into a several hour story arc.\n\nThe third Jail uses the exact same assets with an ice filter, and the aesthetic is tied to a really really really actually lazy story (so far, yet to complete it), so while the game is making fun of lazy tropey writing, it turns around and falls to that problem without realizing it.[/spoiler]\n\nThe combats genuinely very fun, but then the game forces itself into persona 5 mechanics and kneecaps itself due to it.\n\nFirst off, like persona 5 you \"ambush\" enemies and that starts the actual encounters and this is cool and allows for fast grinding later on, it also means theres a short cutscene and waiting period every time you try to start combat. It feels super bad to play, especially if you are trying to do the constant backtracking side missions which just require you grind X enemy in Y dungeon Z times.\n\nAgain from the original game, abilities use HP/SP but unlike the original game there isnt a ticking clock that makes you want to get as far through the palace as possible in one go. In strikers you can leave the dungeon at any checkpoint (which are very common) and instantly return with full stats. So unless you like fighting health spongey bosses with no stats youl be jumping in and out of dungeons often early on when you dont have many tools/items.\n\nTonnes of the game (especially the shibuya areas) feel fake, the attention to detail and things you can do are significantly limited, while this is understandable it just makes it feel strange to have 7 different shops next to each other that all sell 2 things when you have no real reason to actually touch them at all outside the cooking mechanic (which isnt a mechanic as much as a way to make a shitload of items quickly, if you bought ingredients earlier)\n\nIn the end the game just feels like the people making it liked persona 5 (and probably previous SMT games) but didnt really like the downtime aspects of persona 5, or had no idea how to implement it with the road trip aesthetic.\n\nI really wish it was just a lazy Persona 5 Warriors game, because im having fun in extremely quick bursts followed by worse handholding than original p5.",

The difficulty Is pretty well done in the early stages but as you proceed it gets way too easy at the point where you could mash 2 buttons to win easily even at the highest difficulty. positives were the music remix were so good ngl. If you're a massive Persona fanboy or you wanna fund atlus to port more Persona games in the future maybe you should give this game a go , Otherwise get this at a discount. don't put your expectations too high. personal opinion : 6/10",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is exactly what I was hoping for as a Persona 5 spinoff/sequel. It continues the story of P5 in a similar, yet new way and continues to build the characters of P5.\n\nI found the gameplay very enjoyable, with it's unconventional turn-based RPG mechanics mixed in with the action gameplay. The action felt just right, you're able to dash around and attack just like in devil may cry but at the push of a button every stops and it becomes much more like a turn based rpg.\nI don't think they could have implemented this much better, so kudos.\n\nJust like the original the soundtrack is great. I personally prefer it to the original P5, but this is just my style of music. They even added in some Remixes of the original games music.\n\nLastly the story. I find it very good. It has been streamlined with story progression now being tied to your in-game progression, since there is no calendar system. I'm sure it would have been nice to see all characters from P5 return, but think it's better this way. The new additions fit in well too (mostly).\nThe real crime with the story of this game is a PC and switch exclusive problem. The original games aren't on these platforms and therefore many people are most likely going to be out of the loop when starting the game. Therefore they may miss some of the more subtle things, not understand everything or just not care. \n\nIn terms of the port, I did not have any big issues. Some framedrops when things got heated. I did have a few crashes, but only about six or seven in 70+ hours of playtime. Sidenote: This was also within the first two weeks of the games release. I have not tried 1.02 but I assume that is even better. \n\nOverall I recommend this game. It's really great. My biggest issue with it is that the NG+ difficulty might as well be called BS mode, so yeah. Great game. Worth your money.\n...\nBut there's a catch.\nI recommend you at least have basic knowledge of the previous game. I got through just fine knowing the base plot of the P5 and having watched the anime(yes the anime does cover most of the important things). Let's just hope that Atlus do eventually port Persona 5 (Royal) to PC, but I think it's basically a given at this point. :)",

        "content": "[b] Pros: [/b] \n- Continues the story from Persona 5, with new themes. Leads to an engaging, although familiar, experience. Seeing the Phantom Thieves hanging out and having fun in different locales is a treat.\n- The UI is still as stylish as ever. \n- Music is awesome and varied. The new rock-infused tracks fit right in with the jazz music from the original game.\n- Sophia and Zenkichi are great additions to the cast, both having great characterizations and deep and complex backstories.\n- Gameplay is action-packed and hectic. Puts a spin in the typical Musou-formula. Each character have their own unique fighting styles, allowing for different experiences.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b] \n- The gameplay is rather repetitive. You'll be mowing down enemies again, again and again with no signs of stopping. \n- Bossfights are tedious and will test your patience. It will take quite a while to whittle down a boss's health to even half-health. Even mini-bosses aren't exempt from this. \n- Crashes and long loading times happen but are rare. Save often to prevent loss of progress.\n\nAll-in-all, as a Persona 5 fan, I love the game and enjoyed most of it. Love the story, the interactions between the crew, and the new characters. The gameplay is fun enough, although I'm not the biggest fan of it.\n",

        "content": "Game's pretty fun & difficult (especially on Merciless), story is pretty cool but may be confusing for those who haven't played or watched the first 9 months of Persona 5 Royal. Game crashed a couple times (only at cutscene transitions) but it was rare and I believe these have been fixed with the recent beta hotfix, along with problems other players were having when the game launched such as the major \"black screen\" bug I've heard. Luckily I never was hit with it or any other major bugs. I think in my opinion Atlus did a great job with the release of Persona 5 Strikers on Steam.\n\nI 100%'d Persona 4 Golden a little before this came out early. And a little while ago I 100%'d this.\n\nNow we just need a Persona 5 Royal port so I don't have to deal with the inferior version on a console released almost a decade and a half ago, I already have over 400 hours on a New Game+ save on it anyways.\n\nI can't wait to try out the SMT III: Nocturne remaster once I get the chance to.",

        "content": "Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Persona 5 fan, having played the base game several times and Royal twice. I went in to this game only seeing the trailers when they first came out. I'm not big on games similar to Dynasty Warriors, but I still feel like the gameplay was fairly enjoyable for the most part. My biggest issue comes from the story. Sometimes the story can feel touching, but other times it feels so bland and generic. Dialogue got SUPER REPETITIVE, by the end of the game I was skipping parts of the dialogue because it was unnecessary filler. The crashing was also a bit of an issue I had, but it was pretty minor. It only crashed like 4-5 times during my playthrough, so just make sure to save often just in case.\n\nCharacters-\nSince this game follows the events of Persona 5, the characters are something I need to talk about. They had their moments, but they felt nothing like the characters from P5. They all felt a bit 1-dimensional at times, like they had a single character trait and that was it. They ended up feeling more like cardboard cutouts than actual characters. Even some of the new characters fall into this troupe, some more than others. I will say that I enjoyed Zenkichi and Sophia quite a bit in this game. Zenkichi and Sophia almost always had meaningful dialogue that added to their character or those around them. Even though the characters can feel stale at times, some of them had their moments that made me smile or laugh. \n\nRecommendation-\nI don't recommend it, but I'm not entirely against it either. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you:\n-Are a big fan of P5 or the Persona franchise as a whole\n-Aren't playing for an immersive story(at least on the level of P5)\n-Are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior genre\n-Don't mind repetitive dialogue/gameplay\n-Just want to play it for the gameplay/characters\n-Just want to try it for yourself\n\n\nGameplay-\n\u2610  Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\nGraphics-\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful \n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\nAudio\n\u2610 Amazing\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\nAudience\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\nStory-\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Not great\n\u2610 None\n\nDifficult-\n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610  Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\nGrind-\n\u2610 Nothing\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2611 A bit grindy sometimes\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 Insanity\n\nGame Time-\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2610 Endless\n\nPrice\n\u2610 Just buy it\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\n\nOverall Score: 68/100",

        "content": "i haven't had this much fun with a game in a long time\n\ni was skeptical about the game when it was first announced - it seemed flashy and energetic, but i wasnt sure how the game could marry musou combat and a megaten fusion/affinity system together\nbut i was wrong lol\ngameplay is exciting and oozes the persona 5 flourish, while never feeling too visually overwhelming\ni was surprised to find that the general musou focus on slaughtering thousands of enemies isn't super potent here - there are moments of cathartic release where you can wail on waves and waves of shadows, but strikers does a great job of giving you more complex fights with interesting minibosses\neach fighter has something interesting to offer mechanically, which makes it more fun to switch out your party members - even characters i dont like as written are fun to mess around with in dungeons\nthe game isn't incredibly strong narratively, but there are plenty of good character moments over the course of the story to keep you invested - though some may be predictable to those already familiar with neo-persona\nthe new music tracks fit the game well, and the dlc legacy music pack is a welcome addition. getting the innocent sin music to play during fights pumps dopamine directly into my brainstem\n\nthe camera can sometimes be a bit of a pain - not enough to knock points, but something to note\nit's most notable in certain boss fights, where the enemy is moving very quickly around the stage and the camera has a hard time following them around if you're trying to lock on\nsome enemies are also a bit spongier than they really need to be - certain bosses make sense, but some fights feel like they go on longer than they deserve to, and become less a test of skill and more a test of endurance\n\nthat said it's an incredibly solid game\ni hope this pc port sells well - i'd love to see atlus be more willing to port their games over to more platforms\nplenty of games like digital devil saga 1&2, the persona 2 duology, and especially ronde deserve to be experienced by a modern audience",

Game itself Is quite good despite the RPG turn style based changes for a more musou although not completely style live action RPG. In terms of difficulty the same is just right but it can be hard sometimes even on normal in which the player will need to play more smart and master the combat systems rather than using only button mashing. \n\nSoundtrack is superb with remixes from previous P5 and P5R themes and new ones with a lasting impression. \n\nAll in all, recommended but only if you have played the previous titles.",

        "content": "A very good P5 Spinoff, the soundtrack is an absolute banger, the characters are amazingly likable, and the gameplay is fun with a little learning curve for figuring out combos and fun ways to tie everything together. i only have a few criticizms of this game, and they are all nitpicks, so dont take them to heart. \n\n1. certain fusions require the components to be leveled to a certain degree before they can be fused, which has never been done in the series prior, which slows down progression.\n\n2.stat increase bond skills are absolutly useless, because they are expensive... 3-5 points for a +1 is not justifiable.\n\n3. some levels go a bit too fast, but that is more an issue that i fight too well and manage to claw my way through out of sheer determination.\n\n4. the final boss could have been a bit better\n\noverall i love P5, and what they did is they took the criticisms of P5 and acted upon them, all the villains make you feel apprehensive about stopping them, because they honestly have relate able convictions. also as a warning the \"soundtrack\" is played through an app, so no, you cant slap this shit on your phone... unless you do the same type of techno fuckery that i did and brute force it there, because ill be damned if i cannot listen to the best Persona soundtrack in existence on demand.",

So you will need to have played that to understand what is going on. \nStory wise, it is not as good as the original, but it definitely has its moments, and I think its a good sequel that doesn't feel forced.\nAs far as the combat, at first it can feel really off putting because of the Dynasty Warriors style, to remedy this, you can bump up the difficulty to hard. the mini bosses and bosses are actually pretty fun this way and the gameplay elements blend together pretty well.\nDefinitely give this a try if you enjoyed the original Persona 5. it is well worth it.",

The gameplay style change fits so well, the story and the Phantom Thieves were just as great as the first one (maybe even better), the two new characters were written so well and I still listen to the soundtrack and probably will for a long time.\n\nHonestly this game is the perfect sequel for me. Any doubts I had were blown out of the water as this game delivered so much more than I was expecting. If you've played Persona 5 I have no doubt you'll love this game.\n\n10/10 Zenkichi best gramps",

        "content": "Some things to know: \nIf you haven't played base game or Royal please do yourself a favor and play them. This is a direct sequel so reasons are obvious as to why you should play the base game or Royal. Even though this game is technically a spin off it still has its own full story and new characters. This game if you don't know is a warriors game meaning hacking through a lot of mobs, so no turned base combat.\n\nThe Pros: \n-The cast is back and they are just as great as base game. All feel exactly the same as they did from the end of P5 and they retain their growth from the previous game. The interactions with them are all great and that alone was a massive selling point for me.\n- The fighting system is fluid and requires you to think especially in later encounters making combat not just button mashing. \n-All characters are very distinct in their fighting styles and all feel really fun to play.\n-Zenkichi and Sophia are a great addition to the cast and fit right in with the thieves.\n-Haru gets some well deserved screentime after what she dealt with in base-game. \n-Jails are similar to palaces yet unique in their own rights making exploring them feel nostalgic and enjoyable.\n-Music is really good and I still find myself listening to the tracks even after playing.\n-The Va's did an amazing job especially under the restrictions of covid and each character sounds amazing and never really took me out of the experience.\n-Merciless is a great edition and makes the game much harder than before making combat require even more thinking especially for certain combos/ making broken personas in the velvet room.\n\nThe Cons:\n-The first couple of jails fit the same exact formula which is understandable for plot reasons however, it does make each one feel less unique.\n-The game will crash rarely when entering new locations which of course can be not fun especially when you did not save prior. This seems to be a PC problem only.\n-I occasionally received some frame drops in later encounters especially with fights with lots of effects but it runs very well everywhere else.\n-The requests can sometimes feel very grindy and menial which of course can be annoying especially when they are required to fight the reaper and unlock new-game+/merciless.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is great and I will wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who played persona 5. It has its flaws for sure but this game is still amazing. It carries a lot over from base-game which I don't mind but does make the game feel more like an extension rather than a sequel. Its an amazing experience and to all those who haven't gotten into the Megaten series you definitely should these are some of it not the best games ever made.\nScore: 4/5",

        "content": "Okay, so for a PC port this was really good. \nMy only problem with the game itself: \nThe one major problem I had was the game randomly crashing, which was a rare occurrence ( happened only like 2-3 times in the 60+ hours i've played) so as long as you've saved regularly, it shouldn't be a problem. What I can't quite figure out is why it crashed? One of the times it happened I was just walking from one area of the real world to another, it wasn't even if a particularly crowded area with a lot of NPC's. The first time it happened it happened during a dialogue scene (the one in the attic towards the start of the game), which should be even less likely because it wasn't even loading anything at the time. Of course, I am hyping this up to be more of a problem then it actual is, and there is a chance that it may just be something my computer is doing. \n\nstory wise:\nHonestly, I don't know what to say that hasn't been said. This is a sequel game, if you played the original, you'll like this one, if you haven't you'd probably find a lot of the character beats uninteresting. The sole exception to that is the two new thieves, one of which is just adorable and the other of which is one of the funniest characters in any video games I have ever played.  Also, keep in mind that this game is a lot shorter then the original, which to be fair was a long game, but even beyond time spent, the first couple of dungeons were fillery, not bad, just not particularly important. I still had fun with it though.\n\nGame play:\nNo, it is not turn based, and yes the new combat can take a little bit to get used to, but its fun in its own way and I really enjoyed it and it makes this game feel like its own distinct thing and not just Persona 5 expect smaller and a tacked on story.",

        "content": "While this is a longer review, this does not talk much about any combat/spoilers present in the game. This is instead a look at the game from a series perspective, so there may be other reviews more suited to your taste if this is not what you're looking for. I am not including a TL:DR because the review is a little scatterbrained despite it's length. If this helps even one person then I'm glad.\n\nIn many ways, Persona 5 Strikers is like a sequel to Persona 5. This isn't an original statement, as many describe the game this way, but the fact that it can be described as a sequel speaks volumes for one simple reason: P5S is just a spinoff. Atlus, along with the other studio that helped produced this work, were so bold as to mix ideas from the long-standing Persona/SMT with combat likened to Nier:Automata and Devil May Cry. It's very well done; the aesthetic that makes 5 stand out is still present here, and it is very faithful to the original game. I wouldn't say that it follows up perfectly after the release of Persona 5 Royal, (because this game released in Japan about a month before Royal went worldwide) so don't expect any of the characters/content from Royal here. I will say that a lot of the ideas for Royal were taken from this game, such as the thought process behind the Showtime! mechanic, so if you're familiar with some of the more recognizable content they added in Royal which was not present in the base Persona 5, you'll be glad to find it here. \n\nPersona 5 Strikers does contain some slight spoilers for Persona 5, so be warned if you haven't experienced 5 that there may be some things that are present here which could surprise you. I want to mention one key aspect that this game made me constantly think about though: the only thing holding Persona 5 Strikers, a SPINOFF title, from feeling like a main series game, was the lack of any confidant/social link mechanic. While this is disappointing, the fact that this can even be considered a downside should speak volumes for the game itself. There are only two instances in the game where any activity related to hanging out with a friend from the confidant/social link mechanics in other Persona games exist here. However, it should be considered greatly that following the events from Persona 5, you should not even need a confidant/social link bond with the characters in this game, considering that aside from the two new additions, you've already met and experienced hardship as well as friendship with every other character as the Phantom Thieves. \n\nAnother major advantage this game has is replayability and content. In your first playthrough, if you are even just a little adventurous, you will likely fuse most of the personas and have done just about all of the unique mini bosses present. Although, unlike in base 5 and Royal, the hardest difficulty for this game is locked behind a first completion of the game and then the completion of the post-game content. Let me say that if you're like me, and want a challenge from a game, the hard difficulty from a generic playthrough provides more difficulty than Persona 5/Royal's hardest difficulty. The hardest difficulty in this game is much, much more difficult than that. So trust me when I say that this game has enough content and replayability value, especially for those who want the challenge and unique achievements you can only gain through a merciless NG+ run. \n\nAs a final statement for this review, which has been all over the place, there is one more thing I want to mention. Fans of Persona 5 love the game for a lot of reasons; it's not a huge stretch to say it's a masterpiece in it's very flooded genre, which happens to be one of my favorite game genres. In my (and many others) experience, the music for Persona 5 is the one of the best parts of the whole experience. I am especially happy to say that the new music found in Persona 5 Strikers, be it the new battle themes and remixes of old battle themes or the background/tone setting music, is fan-fu**in-tastic. My personal favorite songs are \"Crossover\" and \"Counter Strike\", so be sure to check them out if you love the music but aren't sure about getting the game. Thanks to anyone who happened to read through this, and sorry for not having a TL:DR. If this helps even one person make the decision either to or not to buy the game, then that is enough for me. Let's hope for more PC releases and ports for this series and SMT!",

That battle system and the amazing soundtracks combined make battles a lot more fun and addicting to play.\nAlso the game runs smoothly, 60 fps and well animated character models makes it pleasant to the eyes, ALTHOUGH I have experienced a lot of random crashes during loading times, making hours of playtime go to waste because there is no auto save feature which can make you pissed off.\nThis game is a solid recommendation to the people who enjoyed P5 and P5 Royal and want to see more of the Phantom Thieves.",

        "content": "If you like Dynasty Warriors and Persona you enjoy the game. I'd give this title a 3.5 out of 5 being honest. It's like the best of both worlds but it does everything slightly worse. Example:\n\nPersona 5: Confidants, city activities, new game plus upon completion of the title. \nPersona 5 Strikers: No confidants (replaced by team friendship or whatever its called), all of the previous confidants are gone on vacation in the city and you will never see them. New Game Plus is only unlocked after 100% the game.....which removes the purpose behind the new game plus. I'm not going to play through again for 1 persona.\n\nDynasty Warriors: Large Uninterrupted battles\nPersona 5 Strikers: Have to enter battles the persona way by ripping off the opponents masks then attacking. \n\nNice addition/subtraction: The negotiation system is gone. While I eventually got good at it in 5/R, the minigame was kinda pointless. Just collecting a persona via battling is a welcomed changed.\n\nGood: Can enter/exit dungeons without day constraints. It doesnt pass time. There isn't much to do outside of missions anyways but hey at least they removed this as well. \n\nCombat system is fun. It's not a straight up ripoff of Dynasty warriors and all of the characters feel unique. \n\nStory is meh, predictable, and kinda wears out its welcome. For the first time ever playing a persona series I found myself wanting the game to end. I always loved the story telling between P4G, P3P, and P5/R. When you take away the great story, complex palaces now replaced by really large prisons, and confidants, the game doesn't feel the same. \n\nI was pleased with amount of Persona available and some actually have unique moves. Would I recommend full price? Nope. But do I regret my purchase? No. \n\nThis game's sweet point would be about 40 bucks for someone who's a die hard fan of Persona. I also almost forgot, the performance on this game is wonky. Sometimes it's amazing then sometimes things just break and I just don't get it. I've occasionally seen the shadow on the table of your vehicle doing weird things that snatch your attention. I was in the city and it turned black multiple times and I couldn't see anything. And frame rate randomly drops. I have a 3090 playing between 1080p and 1440p.",

I personally couldn't care less that it was released for Steam since I was gonna play it on PlayStation to begin with, and the Switch version is inferior in many ways. Excellent game if you played persona 5 or 5 royal, if you havent then it drops to a good game. Then again If you played 5 or 5 royal you have a ps4, and should just use that for Strikers/the dancing games if you lack a PS Vita. Apparently this game crashes in some parts according to acquaintances, but I don't plan to stick around to find out if that happens to me. Give me something else to buy, ATLUS. I could throw you some money for Nocturne",

I would genuinely be fine with more of these going forward.\n\ncharacters were well written, old characters get more depth and new characters are great, even those with little screen time.\n\nThere are a decent variety of Personas, not as many as in the main game but that\u2019s to be expected and never feels lacking.\n\nI do have a personal gripe however, one contains spoilers for Persona 5: Royal and one does not.\n\nnon spoiler: Why is Joker\u2019s trauma never explored in this? it would make for great character depth, I know I know protag for people to put themselves onto, but what about the interrogation room? being responsible for the thieves? more? these things are traumatic and deserve to be explored\n\nSpoilers now so continue to read at your own risk \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHey Atlus! So! why\u2019d you take Akechi\u2019s backstory, traumas, and aesthetic and give them to anime tony stark instead of just including Akechi!\n\nThe end of P5R shows he lives. And this shit is so...Glaring. You guys even basically gave him Akechi\u2019s sword along with everything else like how blatant can you be.\n\nReally holding out for a P5R: Scramble because it\u2019s a slightly irksome blemish.",

The characters felt so much more alive and the new characters were so loveable. Gameplay was the by far the best in the series and the jails had such fun creative designs. The soundtrack is incredible, the story felt more impactful and it got me so hooked ever since the 4th jail. The ending was beautiful and the graphics were just stunning at times. It makes me so happy to see how far persona has come and it is by far my favorite game series. This game is worth the 60 dollars completely. I wouldn't even hesitate  to play it again.  I really hope Persona continues to grow as a series and reach more people as it really is special.",

Some of the requests pose more of a challenge than the main story, and the rewards are all the greater for it!\n\n[h1]You are rewarded as you play.[/h1]\n\nAt a glance this can sound confusing. Most games have an ending point as far as content and unlockables about halfway through their playthrough. Even when you thought you unlocked everything and can just farm stuff, the game gives you [i]even more[/i] as you progress through the story; it never feels like it dries out, because the timing of everything you get is well placed throughout the key points of the game.\n\n[h1]Aside from a few bugs, this game is a MUST play.[/h1]\n\nI didn't finish the first palace of the original Persona 5. The game did not captivate me as much as Persona 4 Golden or this game did. But after playing this, I wouldn't mind playing the prequel game and treat it exactly as such. You can enjoy this game even if you haven't played the first game. It's definitely a new experience for the genre, and I highly recommend picking it up to see for yourself!",

The controls.\n\nThe controls for this game is sorta wonky for me. The control layout for keyboard seems to leave some of the keys in odd places, especially during cutscenes. And if you want to use the controller, the tutorial and UI are made for the Xbox controllers (I use Pro and GameCube controllers, so Y and X are always swapped and its always confuses me.)\n\nOther then that, its a great game that I fell in love with immediately.",

Fast forward to now and I can honestly woke me up to P5's overall story. I love this game's feel. I had so much fun just hanging out with everyone in game, I also have now found my favorite character in the Persona series. Zenkichi and Sophia are treasures. Will say this to those who are thinking of getting into the series. This is cannon to vanilla Persona 5 and not Royal so keep that in mind. \nNow if only Atlus would port over Persona 3 and 5 over.

        "content": "A direct sequel to the incredible Persona 5. The main star is an awesome action combat system that is extremely faithful to the trademark Persona JRPG combat mechanics. Every single character is very different and a lot of fun to play. It's so good that I'd be happy if every Persona game going forward had it. A bunch of jamming new songs from Lyn, and returning remixed favorites as well. A lot of quality-of-life changes to fusion. The new characters are interesting, likable, and have good character arcs. It's also a much more manageable ~40 hours than the ~100+ of P5.\n\nThe story is a little fanfictiony, which is somewhat expected in Persona spin-off games. You'd better like Japanese food, because the game basically revolves around how awesome it is. The main departure from Persona 5 is the lack of a \"time economy\" (aka limited days) and the lack of social links.\n\nIt's pretty mandatory to have played Persona 5 (either version, references to Royal are basically non-existent); it will spoil large parts of the plot (if you care about that sort of thing), but more importantly, you'd have a hard time caring about the characters without the 100+ hours of context from P5.\n\n",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers feels like a full-fledged sequel to Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal. By no means is it a cheap spinoff. That said, while I'm sure the game can be enjoyed and understood without playing Persona 5/Royal, I highly recommend either watching a playthrough of Royal, emulating the base Persona 5 (making sure to buy your own copy of the game and ripping it yourself instead of other means, of course!) or if you have a PS4, playing Royal. \n\nStrikers is a 30-40 hour return with the familiar party members of Persona 5, with some new faces, and a new plot. Once again, Atlus outdid themselves in making the party feel like a tight-knit group of friends, and even gave some much needed character development to those left hanging from the original. (looking at you, Haru, Ann, and Yusuke)\n\nPersonally, the shift to a Dynasty Warriors type real-time combat system is... fine. It doesn't do anything special for me, and honestly with most boss/miniboss fights it just devolves into spamming the same couple skills until you can't anymore. That said, the translation from a turn-based JRPG to real-time action was done very well, I just personally would prefer the incredible innovations on the turn-based JRPG formula that the original games provided.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, the game is sublime. Much like Persona 5 itself, the game just bleeds style, on everything from the animations to the menu UI. The music is also just exceptional, especially since it takes some of the best tracks from Persona 5 and gives them some new, almost metal, life.\n\nI did have some issues with random crashes between loads (running an i9-9900k and a 1070ti for reference), so make sure you save often, but they maybe happened four or five times in my fourty or so hours, and would in no way detract from the shining recommendation that I can give for this game.\n\nMakoto best girl",

Once they fix the crashing, it is 100% worth the money and is a fine sequel, but of course isn't on the same spectrum as the original Persona 5 or even the Royal version. If you're a big persona fan, get it but at this point I'd recommend you get this game on PS4 or even switch unless you plan to get into modding the game yourself.",

        "content": "Boy howdy, these Musou Games are getting pretty sophisticated. This game starts about four months after the end of the last game and continues most of the mechanics with some caveats. The day-to-day life simulator is watered down (and made infinitely easier) by just allowing you to pop out of dungeons for a breather and quick restock without losing anything. There are a couple exceptions to this, but nothing that sets the rule.\n\nCombat is still triggered through bumping into shadow surrogates, like the last game, be it by getting the jump on them, them jumping you, or just smacking them and starting proper. Instead of teleporting to a battle dimension, enemies spawn in the world and you fight them like any other Musou. Of note, summoning your Persona or aiming your gun will cause the game to pause while you make your selections, which is nice. There are environmental objects to use to your advantage in addition to the set of skills you've come to know from the base game.\n\nThe story may be the weakest aspect of the game as it's mostly rehashing the same plot as the original game: deadly sins, rejection of cruelty, villains as dark reflections, teenagers using the power of love to kill God. You know the drill. The dialogue is characteristically ham-fisted - which I love - but can turn away the uninitiated. Also, if you were waiting for Ryuji to finally just say that F-Word, you'll get it at some point. I promise.\n\nI'm not quite at the end as of this review, but I estimate the full game takes about 50-60 hours to complete depending on how side-quest happy you tend to be.",

Diving in I expected a half baked experience where you mindlessly killed hordes of enemies from level to level but that was not the case. Everything that you love about Persona is present within the game. Great characters, amazing storytelling, a fun world to explore, and the music(OMG THE MUSIC!) Hanging out with your friends one second and diving into a huge and unique dungeon has never been so fun. Strikers doesn't feel like a spin-off. It feels like a true mainline Persona game. The only difference is the combat that I would say is very similar to the newer Final Fantasy games. After close to 100 hours and a 100% completion, I can confidently recommend this game to any Persona fan old and new. Get ready to become a Phantom Thief once more!\n\nAlso ATLUS!!! Give us more Persona on Steam! Thank you!\n\nEdit: ATLUS IS GIVING US MORE PERSONA ON STEAM! LET'S GO!",

        "content": "I'll start by saying that I am an avid admirer of Persona 5 and it's story. For me, it was the first of the series that I bought and played on the recommendation of a close friend. I grew to love Persona 5 so much that I had ended up playing the game over and over, committing all I could to memory. I wanted to observe every nuance of what made Persona 5 the game it was, or rather is. I even bought the Persona 5 Royal version and fell in love all over again. When I first saw Persona 5 Strikers I immediately looked into it, like any fan would. The trailer video was encaptivating, but I hesitated to buy. The completely overhauled battle system worried me. The original Persona 5 battle system encompassed a long time familiar style of RPG turn-based battles most gamers of the genre are familiar with. Additionally, the time management aspect coupled with building confidants added an endearing allure. Strikers, a now hack & slash version, redesigned combat from the ground up. Personally, I avoid games like this because I recognize my lack of ability and commitment to build the skills necessary to dominate the battlefield. The realization that I may not enjoy this game disheartened me for the longest time. Many times I skipped passed Strikers in the Steam store. However, maybe due to overwhelming boredom, I began perusing the comments of players who had played the game. I can't remember the poster, but they shared the same concern as my own. After reading it, I decided that even if I didn't love the game, that I loved the Persona franchise so much that I'd support it regardless. On that note...\n\nUSE THE GAMEPAD CONTROLS FOR THIS GAME! Standard keyboard setup is not sufficient for this game.\n\nInitially, I disliked combat, and I disliked the feeling of having my Persona 5 world condensed into the shell of an \"efficient game\". What I mean is the play style and aspects of play seemed to have been developed in a way that screams \"instant satisfaction\". Not that it's a bad thing. It just seemed hollow in comparison to its predecessor. I was starting to feel a disconnect to the series. \"I guess they're just trying to monetize on the success of the story.\" The thought spoke loudly in my head. As I started to progress into the game, it was clear that my preconceived notions were wrong.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers, albeit different from Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal, is still an amazing game. The Phantom Thieves of Hearts still managed to steal this skeptical heart of mine. Though I find the battle system complex and difficult to use well, it still offers a new and fun perspective. If you've played Persona 5 or Royal, this game is guaranteed to throw you for a loop. But don't give up. If you're a true Phantom Thief, you'll rise to the challenge and steal the love for this game you once had. Give it a chance. You won't regret.",

The story is pretty good for a sequel, it held my interest for the whole time and had very relaxing times in between. The gameplay is of course not a turn based rpg, but instead a hack and slash. Which might sound not as hard, but trust me its very much as hard if not harder than persona 5's gameplay. In all honesty i love persona 5 and i paid full price for this game and almost 100% completed it at 71 hours in, its worth the money.",

Need to make every attacks and dodges counts XD, utilizing the right personas also part of the strategies in order to beat even the tutorial battle (that pixie one shotted me, yikes.. reminds me of SMT nocturne's tutorial on hard difficulty)\nso this game is still fun to beat more than one playthough\n\nthe story itself is good and the environment is good too(feels like you actually visit the place, like playing YAKUZA games), but unfortunately for player who played the original P5 game, the plot is predictable and pretty similar.\n\nOld review:\nThis game is fun, but the only reason I gave dislike review is because this game CRASHED a LOT between the loading screen or some random events.\nI have to constantly save in every occasions just to make sure I can continue safely, especially on the end game when leveling our chara/personas, it was very frustating when I forgot to save and then I have to farm/do some quest again.\n\nI will change my review when they fixed this issue tho",

The tl;dr is that the gameplay is fun, there's a lot of content and there's a ton of depth in the game's fusion/Persona mechanics. But I can't recommend this game to newcomers and maybe even veterans for a simple issue; the game is horribly optimized. I'm running a 1650 and Ryzen 5 4600; not stellar components but respectable nonetheless. This game barely runs at 60 on mid/high settings at 900p. Its hilarrious just how poorly the game runs but even that isn't a dealbreaker. I wish the game ran better but I can handle a poorly optimized game as long as its stable but hoo boy is this game not stable. I'm around halfway through Strikers and I have had five separate crashes in my 20 hour playtime. Think about it, that's a crash every 4 hours. And the game doesn't have an autosave feature so you're bound to lose progress eventually. This is the ultimate reason why I cannot recommend P5S. If the game gets patches to solve the issues I've mentioned above, then yes, definitely buy this game. But for the time being, keep an eye out for a patch.",

        "content": "TL;DR: Gameplay is awesome, Story garbage, prone to crashing. SCORE: 7/10 Only recommend to fans, wait for Persona 5 for newbies.\n\nEvery review so far focuses on meme-like quotes or one thing that happens in the game. So, I'll tell you whats really in the game. The gameplay is more like Kingdom Hearts but with bigger mobs (not big mobs like Hyrule Warriors). It still retains Persona abilities and fusion but the fusion has been simplified from other entries. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and you have a fair bit of strategy to put into every fight especially the boss fights. The bosses alone will give you the sweatiest palms as they are harder than any of the Persona games by far. What I dislike about the game is its story. The Phantom Thieves are compelled to feel empathy for the antagonist of each city you go to. The writing feels very shallow even more so that in Persona 5. Also its been 20+ hrs for me and the game is still constantly holding my hand while traversing thru the maps. Like come on, don't insult my intelligence. And yes unfortunately the game is prone to crashing and it happens more often while transitioning to a new area. It becomes incredibly frustrating after you defeat an annoying boss and then the game crashes making you restart that fight. It's definitely worth $60 for returning Phantom Thieves but if this is your first Persona game I would wait until Atlus fixes the crashes and the game goes on sale for $40 or below. Also buy the Legacy BGM while you're at it, it makes the soundtrack much better!",

        "content": "Overall decent game? I was very skeptical about a musou Persona game but this turned out pretty well. \nThe core gameplay loop is great, with Persona choices, elemental weaknesses, some cool finishing moves and good ol' All Out Attacks. Narrative is not too bad, either. Just some minor issues outside of the main gameplay loop which really annoy me.\n\nIt's like the game really wants you to waste time shopping and navigating their slowly animated menus- you'd likely see some Sophie jokes in the reviews but this is really criminal in a way that is really stupidly inconvenient. \n\nAlso, the investigation phases are really not fun at all- the locations you get to go to all over Japan are really...kinda boring and feel quite token like you're \"travelling\" all over Japan- but it's really touch and go.\n\nSeveral crashes to desktop, weird camera angles and some minor UX flaws but overall the game is fine.",

Personally I do find the lack of a negotiation system to be problematic sometimes, but that's only because I get way too into the moment and sometimes don't notice when a new Persona has joined my arsenal. Would recommend for any fans of the Persona 5 series - It's a fun game with a fantastic story, and you can always get a refund if you don't like it after trying it out.",

        "content": "A great addition to the persona franchise and gives you more of the P5 team that we all love.\nYes, it's not your typical persona game especially in the gameplay aspect but that is no reason why you can't enjoy it. It really fits the game and honestly, I enjoyed it more at times than the TBS variant, especially once you get into a flow with the mechanics. The other major thing that some will harp on is the lack of the \"social sim\" aspect, it's more as a group collective this time around instead of juggling your time between school, 1 on 1s and the metaverse, you tackle things as a team from start to finish. I don't believe that to be a drawback and fits in with the more fast paced nature of Strikers.\n\nThroughly fun game and would recommend to any Persona fan. Being a sequel to P5, the game will assume you know all prior events and the team members so if you never played P5 it is not \"friendly\" in that respect to totally new players. You can totally have fun with it but a lot will not make sense to you story or even character wise.",

The combat felt rewarding and wasn't just mindless button mashing, the music was top notch, and it was heartwarming to watch cast grow even more than how they did in vanilla P5. Sophia and Zenkichi were also great additions and I really hope we get to see them again in the future assuming that this isn't the end. Now the story did feel rushed at times, but it was still a memorable experience overall that ended perfectly. I highly recommend this game to any Persona fan who's not yet ready to say goodbye to the Phantom Thieves just yet.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an enjoyable game, but doesn't quite stand up to the high bar set by P5 (and even higher bar set by P5R). The animations for All Out Attacks aren't quite as flashy, the game doesn't have as much meat to it, there are a lot of quality of life features missing, and much fewer voice clips for common actions like buying, selling, or aiming a gun (meaning that you're going to hear the exact same line spoken over and over and over again). However, saying that Strikers isn't as good as P5 or Royal is like saying an uncut diamond isn't as good as a 24-karat gold ring; in either case, what you have is still pretty damn good. \n\nIf you've never played P5 before, don't be mistaken into thinking you can just leap into this game. It picks up after the events of the previous game and does very little to backtrack over who characters are or what events happened, which is great for returning fans since they can just right back into the action, but newcomers will be left totally lost. There is probably still an enjoyable story here for newbies, but he finer points will be lost--and considering just how important story is to the Persona series--it is a large thing to miss out on. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever return to this game now that I've beaten it. I honestly prefer the turn-based RPG battles of normal P5, and Royal is just filled with so much better content and quality-of-life features that I've grown so accustomed to that, should I ever feel the urge to jump back into Persona, I think I'll be popping in Royal long before Strikers. \n\nAll that said, however, this was still a damn fun game and I'm glad I played it. I feel like it's even worth full asking price if you're really a fan. If not, than there's no shame waiting for a sale, too. I think the enjoyment this game provides for Persona fans far surpasses any of it's minor gripes.",

The game not being turn-based did scare me a bit and yes, it is very difficult in the first 5 or so hours but after a while I got used to it and when you learn to mix combos and weaknesses it gets really fun to play (the teammates are also super fun to use; Yusuke, Haru and Wolf especially), Jails (basically dimestore Palaces) are very creative and beautiful to look at, the boss fights are incredible and I honestly liked the boss fights in Strikers more than than original P5. The fanservice was done very well, and the music is fantastic as usual (Axe to Grind and What You Wish For blows Last Surprise and Take Over out of the water). The new characters - Sophia and Zenkichi are both phenomenal additions with sick Persona designs and I found both of them to be complex and riveting (and also in the case of Sophia, the most adorable character of All Time). Also runs very well except for 2 crashes. \n\nI do have some gripes but they're mostly minor. The biggest complaint is that it's not entirely stable - I've crashed twice in the game for no reason. Bond points are tedious and if you want to max everything you have to get to bond level 99 which is asinine. The lock-on system is truly horrendous as well.\n\nWhile it may be questionable whether it's worth 60 dollars, it is overall a fantastic spin-off which proves that while Atlus might milk the franchise, they're at least putting effort into it. I recommend this game especially if you loved P4G and P5/P5R. \n\nAnd of course, I, like everyone else, look forward to the inevitable Persona 3 and Persona 5 Royal PC port.",

        "content": "First off, I highly recommend this game if you loved Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal.  It is a great spin-off that actually adds something to the characters' stories from the last game.  I will say that if you have not played the previous Persona 5, then I do not recommend this to be your first game in the series.  The game really does assume that you know what happened previously and only does a bit of background knowledge.\n\nAnother caveat, this game is NOT turn-based like the other Persona games.  Now, while I prefer turn-based combat, this games combat is extremely fun.  It is not just random button mashing, but instead a bit more strategy needs to be put into each fight no matter the difficulty.  I played the whole game on hard and I will say that at the start it will kick your ass if you have no experience playing musou games.  However, once you start to understand the combat, the personas, each character, and the skills then the game becomes a lot more easier (still not easy, but you will have better knowledge into the combat).\n\nStory-wise, this game is extremely strong much like Persona 5/Royal.  Is it as good a story?  No, but then again the length of the game is like one half that of the normal games.  I will not write any spoilers, but I did enjoy the story with each character still being the same, but growing a bit.  It is such a good feeling to see the Phantom Thieves interacting with one another, in both the happy scenes and the more serious ones too.  The addition of some new characters was something that I was worried about, but I think they handled it remarkably well.  They both have interesting backgrounds, interactions, and actually important to the story.  \n\nJust one last mention, the music is fantastic again.  It sounds just like Persona 5 which I loved back when I played it and I still love it now.\n\nIssues I had with the game.  I see that people have struggled with crashes and I will say that I only crashed once and thankfully I had saved like a minute prior.  But, I do think that each person's game will act differently so make sure to save as much as possible!  The other issue I had with this game is just the lack of side stuff to do with the Phantom Thieves like what was possible in the previous versions.  I did not expect nearly as much as the last games, but I think there could have been more interesting \"requests\" with the members.\n\nI highly recommend this game!",

        "content": "I genuinely don't like the [b] original [/b] Persona 5. The characters and story all felt extremely bland to me, with its supposed themes being executed with the bare minimum of effort placed into it. Most characters were bland and some were even annoying. Including the wasted potential of the ideas the game presented, in the end it just left me unsatisfied. The only saving grace of the original game to me was the gameplay, the style, and a few tracks of the ost.\n\nThis game however [b] is not [/b] the original Persona 5 and it really shows, not just with its gameplay, but with its genuine thought and care placed into its characters and plot with only one minor hiccup being the obvious twist. Besides that this game blows the original P5 out of the park with everything it has to offer.\nThe game's new characters Zenkichi and Sophia are some of the best persona characters I've ever gotten to experience, Sophia specifically now being my all time favorite with her fun personality and amazing growth as a person, or in her case an AI. Learning about emotions as the story progresses and learning what it means to have a heart. Zenkichi isn't too far behind her though, being the first adult of the Phantom Thieves does bring in some fun banter between him and them all, usually with him being called \"Gramps\" and teased for being a bit of a dork. Him being part of the police as well adds some more chemistry with the Thieves bringing in a pretty fun dynamic between them reminding them they can't go and break the law for their shenanigans. Both of them make for amazing additions to an already set in stone team.\nThe themes presented with its villains really struck a cord with me this time around actually making me feel some emotion on my part. A majority of them even relate with some of the main characters own lives which makes for really interesting lines of dialogue where they reflect on it and how it must've affected the villains' thoughts.\nThe gameplay is absolutely outstanding with it's fast based combat, being similar to a warriors game of course it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but I really did enjoy it. Every characters moveset felt unique, fun, and extremely flashy. All of which just makes the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nThere are negatives of course, this game may be close to a perfect 10 but there are a few glaring issues with the game.\nCrashes and soft locks aren't a common occurrence but they really shouldn't be happening in the first place considering how it never happens on consoles, I may have been able to get used to it but some people won't.\nThe way fusions work in this game feel incredibly tedious requiring incredibly low level personas to be at levels like 40 and 50 to create the fusion, which later on is a lot easier but in the beginning is absolutely annoying.\n\nBesides those issues however I really think this is the best Persona game in the series. Definitely not a jump on point for newcomers, but I really recommend it if you're already into persona and wanting a fun action game. It certainly made this P4 die hard quite happy.",

I started by making a social link chart (like in the game) and writing down my social links. I act dangerous and mysterious like the main character and started wearing a blazer around when I'm outside (I bought a shujin academy pin.) I'm pretty far in my social link with the girls in the apartment next door, probably 6 or 7 with both of them. I left a calling card too (like in the game) to let them know I was going to steal their hearts. (I know in the game if you date multiple people it's bad but I have until valentines day to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like mementos, where I can dive in and debate people until I improve the worldview of that server. That's like the public perception meter in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think they'll give me Mod on the server.\n\nBasically, does anyone else do this stuff? I used to struggle with making friends and only kissed a girl once (she did not like it). But after playing persona and seeing myself in the main character spot I definitely have become a lot cooler and more attractive.",

As for the game...yeah it's fun if you enjoy hack and slash games like devil may cry, bayonetta etc. Don't expect traditional persona style battles. Other than that this is a pretty solid game, cool story line, beautiful graphics and the return of the phantom thieves. Though 60 bucks for what feels like could be beaten in a week? hmmmm. Even for the hardest of hardcore fans for this franchise..i would wait till it goes on sale",

Some elements will take time to get used to but overall I feel this is absolutely worth playing through. Also the story in this one is a hell of a lot better than the story of the actual Persona 5.\n\nThat said, please put P5R on PC already",

        "content": "An enjoyable sequel to Persona 5. However, if you have not played Persona 5 beforehand, you'll feel a bit behind when the characters make references to things that haven't happened in this game before. If you want to know the full story but don't/can't play Persona 5, I would recommend watching Persona 5 The Animation as it will give you most of the character development needed to understand the relationship between our heroes. The only warning I should offer is that it does crash from time to time. I noticed it really only happened when I used a wireless controller, but once I switched to a wired connection I didn't notice any issues. Save frequently just in case that's not the reason. And although it is a jump from turn-based combat to an active combat system, the game is still extremely enjoyable.",

It is a true sequel to Persona 5 (not royal, basegame P5) as it keeps the superb character writing of the original while not falling to the general \"Persona spinoff character archetypes\".\nThe gameplay might be drastically different to the usual turn-based combat that the series is known for, but they've managed to make a great sequel that has such a different feeling.\nI will say though, the final few chapters of the story fall back on basically repeating story arcs from P5 but with minor twists. The game is aware of this somewhat, and it does come up as a joke that this is incredibly similar to what the thieves has already experienced.\n\nIf you like Persona 5 in any way, I would strongly recommend this game, just remember to save often as the game tends to crash on me randomly",

Without spoiling anything, the story seems to gloss over or ignore some previous pivotal moments from P5 Royal but still stays canon regardless. Absolute must-buy for anyone who played Persona 5!",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers has been in my opinion, one of the best spin offs of the persona series yet. Lets begin this by saying that while you can play this without ever having played persona 5 or persona 5 royal, the game expects you have and all character development is saved for the new comers, Sophia and Zenkichi. With that out of the way, lets start with the pros to the game.\n\nThe graphics, while not as impressive as the original game, still have the p5 charm to it and the overall art style has seen great improvements in my opinion.\n\nThe new tracks like Counterstrike and Axe to Grind as well as the remixes of Last Surprise and Rivers in the Desert make the OST of this game a win in my book, with a overall feeling of high energy in each track.\n\nThe gameplay (once you get used to the controls) is extremely fun, with persona elements such as weaknesses and all out attacks incorporated nicely into the new format. Since this is what you're going to be spending the entire game doing, it does good work to not get stale.\n\nThe story is basically p5's story but with the villains being much more fleshed out and relatable. It also does have a few elements that make it fresh but for the most part it's a lot of the same.\n\nThe voice work and dialogue is surprisingly good and had a few solid chuckles, with Zenkichi, Ryuji, Futaba and Sophia taking the spotlight throughout the game.\n\nNow that that's done, some somewhat nit picky negatives.\n\nPlaying on a keyboard is not advised as the controls are somewhat awkward and require some switching around to make work.\n\nOptions for 4k resolution are simply not here for those who have such moniters.\n\nI found that the game can be rather buggy at times. I had multiple instances where buttons would just stop working, such as my attack button or the enter and escape keys. This would require me to halt all progress so i could restart my game in order to fix it. The game also crashed twice on me.\n\nFinally, your characters don't level up with at the same rate as they do p5, meaning that your main party could be level 60 while the characters you haven't used at all could be level 44. This isn't a major problem until the final boss where a certain feature requires you use all your party members. And if you haven't leveled up all your members equally, then it's time to hit the grind stone for a few hours so can actually stand a chance.\n\nOverall, these negatives didn't do much in the way of harming the overall experience. I thoroughly enjoyed strikers and recommend to anyone who's a fan of the persona series. It's well worth the money and a good way to kill 35+ hours.",

        "content": "Even though the game is only about 40 hours long It's a great game and a sequel to Persona 5, The cutscenes are amazing and voice acting and lines are better than the original game in my opinion, The new characters are fun to play with and also have great voice acting. The game doesn't leave you bored due to Its time mechanics and the requests you get, another great feature is the ability to revisit jails and replay boss fights. I'm a big fan of the post-game world since you don't have to repeat the entire game again to reach the grinding point, but of course if you wanna replay the game you can complete the new requests and start a New Game+ . Overall I really recommend this game if you're a fan of Persona 5 or the Persona series",

        "content": "I was positively surprised with the complexity of combat system - every mechanic present in Persona 5 is here, from All-out-Attacks, Baton Passes to Showtime Attacks, with some new additions. Seriously, combat is *really* good. Personas fusions and customizations are also very good, even if there are fewer Personas than in the mainline games.\n\nUnfortunately, the other main part of Persona gameplay loop, the time management, is non-existent here. While a shame, it's understandable based on the premise of the game; P5S shows a much more compact story than mainline Persona games, and there's little place for in-depth systems from the original, such as Confidants and such.\n\nAs for the quality of the PC port... crashes and weird antialiasing aside, trying to set up a working keyboard and mouse controls almost gave me an aneurysm. KB+M default controls seem to be made by a person who never touched a PC. All in all, it didn't diminish my experience by much, just made the first two hours of so more frustrating then they need to be.\n\nAll in all, I was afraid this game would be a cheap cashgrab, feeding on the love people have for Persona 5. But it's not, there's a lot of actual quality here; you just need to remember it's a action spin-off, not full Persona experience.",

It's damn good.\n\nThis is not a dynasty warriors - style offshoot, a la the fire emblem or zelda warriors games; this is a true, blue sequel.\n\nStory wise, it kinda rehashes the themes of the third semester in P5R, but that's not a bad thing. Some things are better touched on, and some things are less approached. It's a different look at the ideas. In addition, there's a lot of something both P5 and P5R were lacking: team building. The crew hangs out a lot. I mean, A LOT. there's good elaboration of character dynamics, a lot of humor, and it leaves you feeling warm inside the way well written characters do.\n\nThe new characters are well written and enjoyable (much more so than Kasumi, in my opinion). They find their place fairly quickly and latch on to you the way the others did in their own time.\n\nGameplay wise, it's dynasty warriors with some twists. A lot of components of traditional persona combat are integrated, but moved to a reaction based real time style- think of it as the changes from Dragon Age: Origins to DA2, but better. (in my opinion, much better). Strengths, weaknesses, technicals, baton passes and showtimes- they're here.\n\nThe soundtrack is, as expected of the persona franchise, fulla bangers. Look foreword to it.\n\nI was glad to hang out with these weird kids in japan again, and I was not disappointed.",

        "content": "They did great work on this game. It reflects off of Persona 5 and they still keep the Persona 3 vibe, style, and music like its other games. \n\nIf you are a big fan of Shin Megami Tensei, and the older Persona series, you will like this.\n\nAlthough the game's style is much different, and inspired by the types of fighting style games like\nHyrule Warriors Age of Calamity, and Dynasty Warriors.\n\nIts a mobby hack and slash game, so if you want a ton of action this is a much get. Its not a turn based\nRPG like the other titles but you still kick some ass.\n\nWhats great is that instead of just trying to remember a ton of moves, they have them shown\ndown at the bottom of the window of your game to show you what to press if you dont remember how to do\nsome moves. You can also look at the tutorials again in the Options Menu in case you missed something.\nInstead of mashing at the keys, its good to get to know your moves. If you dont you may lose much faster especially\nif you run into a mid boss or something nasty.\n\nIts got a ton of Story, good Music, it has its suspense moments, and comedy too. It has that Anime/Manga feel of it as well.\n\nIm not a reviewer snob (like yelpers) but just leaving an honest review, and its gameplay.\n\nI think the only thing i would complain about is that they dont leave an option to watch the cutscenes\nyou just completed. So if you want to see them again, you dont get to.\n\nI have the bonus content they dont provide any of the animations, only the behind the scenes of the production.\n\nOther than that its still a solid, and clean game. I havent ran into any bugs yet. \n\nThe game is flashy, its colorful, its not plain, and the Ui looks pretty good.\n\nWorth every penny. Buy it!! BUY IT NOW!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STILL HERE OwO!\n",

        "content": "I definitely enjoyed this game, but I do have a few bones to pick. Overall? I love it, and definitely recommend it. But I also can't imagine enjoying it anywhere near as much if I hadn't played the prequel.\n\nLoved:\n\n- The travelling by camper van premise. And you can still decorate inside - Nice touch.\n\n- Yusuke. No lie, he's my favourite character. So weird, and usually the one to make me crack a smile or laugh.\n\n- Graphic style. Easy on the eyes!\n\n- Characters, in general. You definitely get a good dose of each of their personalities in the game, which is great.\n\n- Game mechanics. I'm fine with turn-based games, as Persona has been until now, but real time is definitely so much more fun. You can use also use objects in the environment to pull off different moves. Not novel or anything, but definitely makes the battles more dynamic. \n\n- The voice acting. I usually listen to the original voices over the English voices because the latter often bothers me. But here? The voice actors nailed it. Lots of emotion, tone, and personality. That said, I suggest changing the audio configuration ASAP in game, as I find of the base levels of background volume to voice volume to be imbalanced, and sometimes I could not hear the voices over the background music.\n\n- Music was great, as always (okinawa jail bgm is one of my favourites in the game). The upbeat and catchy songs were also very fitting. Having some of the music and songs from P5 was a nice touch/connection, as well.\n\nBones to pick:\n\n- Game length. I did everything possible in about 43 hours in my first run, and I took my time. It's action and content packed with not too many extras, but I had expected there to be a good 20 more hours (including extras) considering its predecessors. I ended up cursing the whole \"only 1 month of summer vacation\" standard of Japan as the reason why the game had to be \"short\".\n\n- Linear/simple story. Doesn't usually bother me, but having played other persona games, it's simple by comparison.\n\n- Personas. So many were cut out in this game - and Persona 5 already had a bunch cut from Persona 4...I had been looking forward to discovering them, seeing how they'd be animated and going to town with them, but there are definitely far fewer.\n\n- Less sneaking around. Ambushing enemies from behind sofas, tables, corners etc in P5 had been fun. In this game it's mostly ambushing from above in some form - nice add-on, but I don't think it should have replaced the other ambush methods. I had also anticipated ambushing from actual shadows/blind spots, which happens in P5, but there wasn't really any of that in this game. It also bothered me that you could perch on some things but not others - e.g. traffic poles (Shibuya arc), but not the concrete lanterns/posts, or even low rooftops (Kyoto arc)? Couldn't see the logic behind that. Also a little disappointed that you couldn't ambush from trees. I guess because of the \"phantom dash\" distance you could leap to various perches, it seems the potential for the context was too limiting.\n\n- I do miss the one on one, sometimes one on two, bonding scenarios from P5. You get a handful of bonding chances in Strikers, but not many. Instead it focuses on group bonding, which shows how tight the Phantom Thieves group is. \n\nPetty disappointments:\n\n- Protagonist has virtually no role this game. Kinda just there to watch his friends be the ones to help/inspire others this time. Would have been nice if each character had their own arc, in addition to the group dynamic, like P5 did.\n\n- Protagonist wears his glasses all game. I was hoping I could take them off...As far as what's been suggested he doesn't even need them, anyway!",

That and the crashing problem but hopefully they can update it and fix that.  The game crashed for me about 10 times but luckily I didn't lose too much data.  Other than these two things, I really love this game!!  It is so much fun to play.  Just walking around and enjoying the scenery and the music is fun.  The fighting is also fun.  I'm still working on doing the extra stuff so I'm not completely finished yet but I have to say that I think this game is so awesome.  I was looking forward to playing it for the past couple of months and it did not disappoint in the least.  I did play Persona 5 a while ago so I know everyone well and it's really cool that they made this so that we can see them again.  Everyone is just as cool as they were before and there are a couple new characters who are also very cool.  The voice actors are all very good (I use the Japanese).  The graphics are also very good.  It's very shiny and bright.  Overall, I will give this game an A+++++.  I will keep at it until I get everything and then I'll probably start over.  I think it's nice that they give you the option to select your difficulty level.  Next time I play, I will try hard mode.  I don't suppose there is any chance of them making another sequel but I can dream.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes Persona games.

        "content": "Alright, so you can enter into this game with no knowledge of the P5(royal not needed) and be fine, you can understand and like this story, it just improves it if you do know.\n\nGame play, first ever muso(idk the spelling of the game) I've played that I feel challenged in from something other than more hp. You actually have to use your brain while playing. Also although not a turnbased game like mainline persona games, it translates the persona turn based elements very well in gun and skills.\n\nStory, so far characters have been great, entire cast is back, with 2 new main characters who are both interesting. Charters feel exactly as they should be and story is intriguing, and it's neat how with the jails it seems each jail owner didn't make it through desire, but trauma, so it makes the villans more interesting.\n\nAlso it's basically P52, which is funny because in one of the trailers a 2 almost appeared after the \"5\" and then \"S\" butted it out. It is a sequel.\n\nVisuals, Looks like a persona 5 game, but not only that the jail aspects are really polished, not only does each jail seem unique, the quality of the details is amazing. Other muso games seem to not care all that much, but this one just random buildings may have defined shops and markets or be their own specific thing. It's not just slightly different colors. Nor is it copy and paste. Though this does come at a cost. It's not one big map but many decent size areas per jail with load times. I'm on a gaming laptop and can run it at around 1.5 resolution, max graphical settings, 60 frames non combat(btw max cap is 60, so wait till someone mods it for that to change) which lowers to 40 in hectic combat(which I never actually notice, unless i'm looking at my fps number). I say all this is because between each area it's about 10-20 seconds. Which isn't short enough to ignore nor long enough to alt tab. This is my biggest complaint with the game and that's saying a lot. \n\nAll i can say is compared to muso games this is probably the best(although i've heard hyrule warriors was made by the same studio so maybe that's just as good) in every department.\n\nI would recommend buying this game at full price even if not a persona fan. \n\nNot a giant downside to me but the social life aspect is toned down a lot. P5R was I'd say 25 percent social life, 60 percent game, and 15 percent cutscene, this is 65 percent game, 25 percent cutscene, and 10 percent social life",

The new battle system was addicting and it worked very well and I loved having the whole Persona 5 cast from the start. The concept of taking a road trip across Japan in classy 50's Style RV was just Icing on the Cake! Overall I enjoyed the game I just wish there were social links and the areas you Visited were bigger and you could go inside buildings and explore, which I hope they do for Persona 6. Well Done Atlus please bring Persona 3 FES to steam too and give it the same treatment as P4 Golden. And make sure we can control are party members!",

Missing good ol' persona mechanics but this spin off was amazing. Story wise, I felt the story was much better compared to Persona 5. If you love persona or you haven't played one and you like hack and slash with some strategy and story telling, I definitely recommend this game!\n\nI am happy to keep getting persona ports to PC :')",

Really enjoyed the story, characters and new music. Hoping Atlus does more experiments like this in the future, I think the series could do well with it. Definitely play Persona 5/The Royal before starting this, as you will be completely lost on key plot points if you haven't. Other than some crashing issues, this version is fantastic and I'm excited to see the rest of the Persona franchise make its way to PC.\n\nWould die for Sophia and Zenkichi, 11/10",

Otherwise I definitely cannot recommend this game at all on PC\n\nEDIT: I finally got it working after I uninstalled it, and deleted all my P5S files from %appdata%.\nIf it weren't for the issues listed above, this game is definitely fun to play if you enjoy any of the musou games. Its kind of a mix between something like Kingdom Hearts and the Warrior series. However, based on the fact that I cannot play this game in fullscreen and many crashes in between gameplay, I still cannot recommend it YET. Until they fix it these core issues, I would 100% recommend this game to those who want to sit back, relax and play a hack n slash Persona game",

        "content": "Pretty fun hack-and-slash experience that still makes you stay on your toes via the Weakness and Strength etc. system. The story was pretty good but felt a bit restrictive with what the player can do on their daily life, something older fans may dislike but isn't that big of an issue. \n\nGraphics are alright although it did have some optimal issues (game crashing whenever leaving the Metaverse or frames dropping drastically out of nowhere).\n\nCharacters are solid still including the newer ones that were introduced for this game. Their backstory really show how and why they ended up like how they were in the game and it really showed how much resolution they have achieved by the end. \n\nControls on the other hand were very complicated in my opinion (on keyboard) so a controller is highly recommended as it makes the game way easier (and it solves the massive frame drop issue if you disconnect it and reconnect it).\n\nStory was alright, the way it introduced the villain's backstories really makes you feel for them and want them to change for the better. The story could be better in my opinion but given the circumstances (in game time restrictions) \n\noverall, again, a nice hack and slash anyone can play. Although I believe that the experience is way better when you have played Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal. Still a game anyone can pick up and give a try and be welcomed to the series",

Story is good, though a good part will be lost if you haven't played Persona 5, which you should anyway (if you don't own a PS3 or PS4, it works flawlessly on RPCS3 (PS3 emulator) as long as you have a good CPU). The only bad thing about it is there isn't more of it (it's still 40-60 hours, and it's all great). There's also no New Game+, though I wouldn't be surprised if it's patched in later as you can save your clear data.\n\nOverall, this is easily one of the best new games I've played in the last 5 years if not longer. If you've played Persona 5, you'll probably love it, and if you haven't, then what the hell are you waiting for?",

        "content": "A fun muso game with a familiar cast and world with the same staples Persona 5 is known for such as it's great sound track and its style is also faithful. Combat is enjoyable and the way combos expand the more you play as each character is a good way to get you playing everyone and seeing each thief's arsenal while in combat. I really liked seeing the existing cast interact more in what felt like a more natural way. With new cast members thrown into the mix, it only strengthens the character line up within Persona 5's world. Certain characters however do end up boiling down to their singular trope such as Futaba being more egregious or Makoto doubling down on her motherly role within the group. \n\nOverall story was interesting enough to keep me wanted to see how it would progress. However, there were a few moments that felt repetitive in the game play when it came down to locations. Some areas feel copy/paste of one another which is a bit of a let down considering what potential could have been met.\n\nThe main negative however that I'd consider the real reason behind whether this game is worth getting on Steam is that it crashes. Not just once or twice but multiple times. Personally, it crashed 15+ times but some friends have had it crash much more or much less. It is not a great port over onto PC and with these issues being so irregular, be prepared to what you could end up dealing with.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is an amazing game. \n\nActing as a sequel to, and taking place during the summer after the events of Persona 5, you get to reunite with the members of the Phantom Thieves to travel across Japan, traversing \"Jails\" in order to save humanity. Unlike the turn-based combat style of the original Persona 5, Strikers has combat similar to the 1 vs many style of the Dynasty Warriors games, with fluid transitions between combat and traversing the Jails.\nThe game has a great story that builds upon the world of the original game, and I definitely welcomed new characters like Zenkichi and Sofia, but I would suggest not playing this game until you play Persona 5 first, because this game is a sequel and spends no time introducing people. \n\nLike other Persona games, the soundtrack is phenomenal and a joy to listen to. \n\nHowever, in regards to the PC version, I have had issues with the game crashing several times (only during loading screens), so remember to save often.\n\n*Note: I would not advise completing all achievements for this game, mainly because you will need to max out all BOND Skills, which took me over 10 hours exclusively grinding one boss over and over again just to get enough EXP to complete the achievement.",

I keep hearing some of the \"best Persona 5 writing\" is here and whilst there are some good lines/scenes, imo it's a step down in every aspect compared to P5/Royal. \n\nStrikers is just a road trip with the old gang and real time combat, where very little is mentioned about their past/recent history and Haru's forgotten she's your girl. Definitely think this was developed to be as friendly to newcomers as possible. \n\nStill a good game though, 7.5/10...........Now bring the proper Persona 5 to PC Atlus!",

More than that, it's a sequel to the original P5, not Royal, so certain characters and events didn't happen in this timeline.\n\nOther than that, soundtrack is superb as always, and visuals are gorgeous. Gameplay is dynamic and fun. Overall, if you were a fan of P5, you'll love this as well.",

        "content": "Very fun combat system. I am fans of dynasty warrior game since on playstation 2, and this battle system with my favorite persona character is really awesome. especially every persona move has different specials! I play on easy mode since I am casual pleb and no time to grind exp/item, tried normal mode at early stage and I keep dying from the 1st boss til I find out I have to grind exp to create persona that allow me to deal weakness on the boss and it's all become so easy and just reading the boss move pattern. for now I am just focusing on completing the game, might be continue on normal mode after I finished. Normal mode does give you those code vein boss vibes since you have to be careful on the attack, but here the boss have really high HP so all you need is timing and reading move pattern. \n\nHope this kind of combat will continue to Persona 6.\n\nTLDR : 10/10 will recommend to everyone who likes musou game. and a must have for persona lover.",

        "content": "(Written at Ver. 1.0.0, please verify accuracy on future versions.)\nTO SUMMARIZE:\nI really like this game as a sequel to Persona 5. Standalone, the most glaring thing is you're dropped straight in assuming you already understand Persona 5's plot. While I feel like you would enjoy the game regardless, I highly recommend visiting the first Persona 5 game. If you're in a pinch, watch a playthough or in the worst case scenario the anime (though not very well received.)\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI have had numerous crashes since the early release day and to my knowledge there is no fix yet, which is a little off-putting. If you do decide to get this game for PC, please practice good saving habits if only for this reason. Save as often as possible, as this game does *not* autosave. While I still enjoyed the experience overall, the crash issue made me wish I got it for console instead. There are also a few game-breaking bugs which you will have to avoid. For example, you cannot play in fullscreen or borderless windowed modes or the game will go into a black screen if you trigger a cutscene. You must play in windowed mode as far as  my experience has shown me.\n\nWith that said, the gameplay combines aspects of Persona 5's JRPG elements and combat, with musou mechanics you're probably familiar with most \"Warriors\" games. While it has its flaws, I never found myself bored. Fights felt interesting, though sometimes downright easy playing on \"Normal.\"\n\nAs a note to Atlus, you've got to be more timely with bug-fixes and more courteous to your PC audience if you want to keep going with this PC release approach. At the very least keep some sort of communication with the player base acknowledging the issues.\n\nSTORY:\nPersona 5 Strikers takes place after the events of the original Persona 5. It does not take into consideration your past romance(s?) or confidants, nor can I say it makes any clear reference to the events of Persona 5 Royal. You may notice some themes being reused in the first few levels of the game that are similar to Persona 5's palace themes. I will say, however, that they are distinct enough to not feel like a rehash. The antagonists feel unique, and contrast heavily from the precursor of this game. \n\nOverall, without giving anything away, while the writing is definitely not as good as before it's pleasant for those already familiar with the first game, showing strong character growth in contrast and an interesting new evil to take on. I personally believe this is a worthy sequel story-wise.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nI'm hoping the glitches are resolved for the PC release at some point. That said, I can comfortably recommend this game to people who are itching for more of the Phantom Thieves adventures, those looking to beat up massive hordes of shadows, or even if you're really weird and want to get introduced to Persona 5 with this game! I'm giving the game a thumbs up, but begrudgingly so in light of the current state of the PC release. But for my purposes, this game was worth the occasional crash and being forced to play in Windowed mode.",

It takes time to get used to in the beginning but it comes to you over time when you unlock abilities for the characters that you play.\n\nAs for the story, it is the \"sequel\" to the Persona 5 game (that's only on the PS4 at the moment) and not Persona 5 Royal. So far, the game is very enjoyable with its combat and story. More or less similar to Persona 5's story. It just has its own twists.\n\nBefore I go,\n\n\"Oh, am I mistaken? I thought I heard something about delicious pancakes.\" ~ Goro Akechi",

I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt's getting a negative review from me after 20+ hours because the people who are being fucked over by the constant problems the game has deserve a voice.\n\nThis game has a ton of issues when it runs for many users; I had the issues up until I forced the game to run in Administrator mode, and that literally fixed all of my problems. I haven't had a crash since day 1; on Day 1, I had three crashes. I found the suggestion from a user who had tried making sure the game ran in Administrator and it fixed all of their issues.\n\nI have friends suggesting that the Kyoto boss area is basically unwinnable right now, and it has a crash right after that you can't get past. I'm looking to try and see if that happens to me, as I'm a few in-game days away from that particular date.\n\nThis game is great, the port itself needs some tweaks, but apparently Atlus nor Koei Tecmo plan to do shit about it.\n\nI've lost a lot of respect for Atlus, and now I'm not sure if they deserve any more of my money past this point; Persona 4 Golden was a beautiful port, and it was patched with the majority of its issues solved within days.\n\nIt's been almost two weeks from this game's release and not a fucking word of anything getting changed or improving. Dev's want to sweep this under the rug and get away with it.\n\nIf you can, and you also reviewed this game, swap it to negative and get this game noticed by the Dev's so they do something.",

If you are a \"slow and steady\" gamer like myself it shouldn't affect your play experience.\n\nStory isn't the masterpiece of its source material but is ultimately a worthy successor to to Persona 5.\n\nOn that note; bring Royal and 3:FES to steam please. Hell, i'll even take the dancing games while we are at it.",

I would of preferred the combat system in the other Personas.  Each time I start playing it after about 20 minutes or less I already want to put the game down and be done with it since the combat just ruins it for me. It's like a Dynasty Warriors game and those types of games just aren't my thing. \nOne of the few things I really did like about this game is the ability to swap characters and walk around in the dungeons with them, among a few other small things.\n\nOverall I would rate this a 5/10 \nAverage,",

Nah, It's just a very good game ^^",

        "content": "TLDR: Finished Persona 5?  Get this.  Never played Persona 5?  Probably not for you.\n\nIf you've played Persona 5 and are on the fence about this because of it being Dynasty Warriors combat, take the plunge.\n\nThe combat is actually way more Persona than I expected.  In fact, for difficult fights I spent way more time hitting the Persona button, exploiting weaknesses, switching characters to heal/buff, etc.  In any event, as someone who usually really doesn't care for DW, I found the combat in the game pretty enjoyable.  The dungeons were at least as interesting as anything P5 was doing, too.\n\nUnlike typical DW games, the draw here is the story.  This one is a direct story sequel to the Persona 5.  If you liked that story and want to just hang out with the dudes again on a road trip around Japan doing Phantom Thieves stuff, then play this game.  You don't get the time management social game from the mainline Persona games, but you get a full-fledged, consistent with Persona 5, sort of on-rails story.  It's really solid.\n\nOne other thing that I didn't really expect, the general presentation of the game is also pretty consistent with the quality of Persona 5.  The wild animations, menus, punk rock aesthetic, the music, voice acting... it's all here and it's very much a continuation of what P5 had going on.\n\nAll that said, with how much time and energy is spent on a story that assumes you played Persona 5, even if you really dig the combat for it's own sake, this is only really for people who have played and finished P5.  The story here is good, but it does not at all stand on its own 2 feet.  Tons of references to the events of P5 and definitely an assumption that you're already familiar with the cast.",

        "content": "So right off the bat the game is great, solid 8 or 9 out of 10, and if you think you'll like it, or even if you're on the fence, I'd recommend picking it up at some point. \nIt is quite rare for me to purchase a game at full price after a release, but I want this release to do incredibly well so that atlus, and by extension sony, will see the profit and bring games like persona 5 royal(please), God of War, Bloodborne, etc more quickly to pc. This being said I won't be softening any criticisms below whats here is a genuine face value of the game.\n\nAnimation, story, and interaction\n-This game is purely more persona 5 with it's character interactions. Given there is no confidant system or romance options, so waifu wars don't work here, but if you enjoyed the casual phantom thief bits from persona 5 this is a treat.\n-The music is purely high quality stuff, mostly all of the new tracks written for this game sound great. From the first prison's music to the final bosses it's all persona standards, and even if you aren't a fan of it, the game allows any persona music to be the main soundtrack.\n-Most of the animations are pretty well done, primarily the new showtime special attacks are beautifully done, each character has their own unique animation matching their personality. Honestly Joker has the most basic sadly because of his many persona options.\n\nThe Gameplay    \n Perspective of a playthrough on hard first time using a ps4 controller via an xbox controller layout\n\nFrankly I love the combat style of this game, it advertises itself as being a hack in slash, which by technicality is true. Coming from a hard difficulty perspective, I entirely believe that hard is the best way for this game to be experienced. \nBasic attacks and combos --- Basic attacking is unique to each character however they all share similarities. Combos are all simple at face value being either   X-Y    X-X-Y     or   X-X-X-Y                 but they can get depth from stringing them together, but what makes the combo system unique is how each of those inputs will cast a persona skill, whether it be a buff, debuff, or skill. These combos likewise use no precious sp, so in longer fights they are instrumental so that joker doesn't develop magic dysfunction as the boss pulls out a second health bar. \n\nMore advanced unique movesets ---  each character has specially made attack animations and mechanics and I will attempt to list them here without any spoilers. Some overlap but that's to be expected\nJoker- has a basic dagger gun moveset based around getting quick persona combos\nRyuji- focuses on charged hits that deal incredible damage, and can prevent staggering with a self buff\nAnn- Can imbue her whip with fire that allows her to deal with an enemies weakness from basic attacks\nMorgana- simple normal moveset, becomes car for special moveset. nuff said\nYusuke- Is based around unique combo counts, where Y activates a parry frame, and if successful he can add more hits to a combo counter\nHaru- Purely aoe strength, her persona combo strikes are large and lingering and all of her hits are powerful\nMakota-buffs her large combo attacks with nuclear, uses johana to ride down enemies with X-X-X-Y\nFutaba has the same role to the point of redundancy. The largest change is the added support where she increases showtime gauges\n\nCounterstrikes\nNot only is this my favorite track in the game against japanese ironman lol, but it is a skill in the new bond system that I quite like. This skill means any last minute dodges allow the character to immediately retaliate with a persona attack. Get this skill immediately it is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThief dash aka area hopscotch \n-dash to a piece of scenery and interact with it dealing damage of a certain type. Honestly I really like this system, I like the little differences in character the interactions show, and it gives the player more control over the terrain. All bosses use the interaction really neatly as well with the least creative being the final boss who I won't spoil\n\nOkay now time for the nitpicks\nThe slightly bad \n\nSpammed with tutorials at the beginning - LIKE DEAR GOD the first few hours of the game you won't escape these things. It's like they were stalking me waiting to pop out from a corner EXCUSE ME SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT BURN. Like they serve a purpose but if you already know how the status works from persona 5 you will get annoyed fast. Doesn't help that they give you messages about EVERY character when you switch to them, which playing all of them from the beginning, it gets irritating fast.\n\nThe game always has you fighting with 3 other ai controlled phantom thieves unless you take them off of your party, and I would discourage doing this. Usually the ai are protected from their own stupidity by generous I frames and resistance to attacks, and they seem to avoid using sp..........Unless they are healing\n               \nHOWEVER, some times the ai just get in your way, they will die like idiots and leave you fighting alone, just because the game didn't save them. Like for instance, and I'll avoid spoilers, but one boss creates stupid walls of lasers to hit you, and these things move incredibly slowly. I'd have to drop my controller on the floor to get hit by these things, but the ai will not avoid them. They don't understand that the back of the platform is the only safe spot so they stand there and get whacked. It's honestly infuriating.\n\n-So this is a genuine problem but a strange one. So this game lacks all interaction with side characters who weren't phantom thieves, so there is no takemi or iwai in this game which is already pretty sad. Instead their shops are combined into a shop Sophie runs from wherever the thieves are at that moment. Now breaking the disbelief that sitting in the middle of an island a delivery could get there in a matter of moments, this shop seems like a good way to get the thieves items from anywhere. The problem lies in the amount you can buy, as the amount is always from 1-4 of an item, including healing(I think the most is a 120 heal later in the game which you can get 4 of at a time). Throughout the game this isn't an issue, it works well in fact to stop you from skyrim healing through every fight, BUT AT THE END, there is a gauntlet of tough refights with bosses as well as dangerous shadows for the postgame content. This practically requires decent health resources as well as sp items, but the only way to restock this dumb shop is by spending time in the metaverse, but not just that winning fights. That means you have to run through an area killing everything several times over to get the heath resources needed to beat some of this tough fights. The shop also contains incredibly rare cooking items, specifically that POS coffee bean that is never there but is needed for 2 post game special recipes, so get to grinding that last area. I swear if the enemies in that last area weren't pushovers to a grenade launcher I would have lost my sanity\n\n-This game has no Satanael. None of the awakened personas from persona 5 are here, every single member of the main cast has their originals, Morgana still has gorro, Ryuji still has captain kid, Ann has Carmen, Haru, has M'lady etc. It's pretty mentally annoying especially since Morgana HAD to become max rank as a confidant, and thus had to have an evolved persona.\n\nOkay THE REALLY BAD\n-The game has a bug where it softlocks after a particular boss...... This did not affect me but it is worth noting\n-There can be infinite loading screens........This did not affect me\n-The game doesn't start for some people\n- And finally the most annoying one, this thing crashes randomly in loading screens, and it's painful and this one did affect me. I had to live in fear half the time because I had made significant progress, and a visit to Lavenzia could outright delete that time spent. It was frankly awful and has not been patched as of this review.",

        "content": "Great music as always, with classic remixes and top tier new tracks. Story is a little better than expected out of a spinoff game, though the fact there are no mentions of Royal content whatsoever is disappointing. The core gameplay is actually really fun and not as much of a deviation from traditional combat as you'd think, and it really highlights how cool the Phantom Thieves are meant to look when moving and fighting simultaneously as a team. The Personas available feel very limiting (especially the late game ones) but fusion is relatively in depth and fun to play with. The \"real life\" exploration is also constricted but the different settings the game takes place in are charming and nice to have to make the game feel more like a mainline title.\n\nMy only major complaint is the crashing, which is a complete pain in the ass in a game without autosave. Save often! Other than that, there are only a few small annoying issues, such as shop items having incredibly low stock, money being a major bottleneck even after 80 hours + full completion, way too many BOND skills, and Persona stat changes feeling useless.\nOverall, P5S is a fun game that Persona 5 fans will almost certainly have fun with.",

        "content": "Initial Thoughts/The Story: Firstly, let me say this game is absolutely incredible! It's a fantastic follow up to vanilla Persona 5. And if you haven't had the chance to play either Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal then you can pretty much jump into this game semi-blind, there are a few things spoiled but nothing too major I'd say. I didn't think this game would be all that great when it was first announced but after playing it and beating it today, I can say it's a lot better than I anticipated. Especially as this is technically a spin-off. I can confidently say that this game is the best possible sequel to Persona 5 we could receive. Atlus and Koei Tecmo really out did themselves.\n\nThe combat/gameplay: Gone is the Confidant/Social Link system from previous main Persona games and in their stead comes a story progressed system. The game does not overload you with confidants and stats to raise (which in my opinion is a great thing!) as the game progresses with the story and doesn't move on until you're ready, so you can spend what would be considered two separate days in Persona 5 just grinding in the jails as Persona 5 Strikers will not move on until the next day until you're ready and have finished what you want for that day. Next are the Bond Skills. These essentially replace confidant abilities and offer so much variety in gameplay. You can invest your points into skills that: increase your health and sp (something I seriously recommend for later on in the game), allow you to crack open safes that contain decent loot, increase your physical and magical attacks, allow your allies to heal you from alignments, and more! These bond points are a welcomed feature in my eyes! Now for the big thing: the new combat system. I must say, I haven't played a warriors-styled game until now but I am pleasantly surprised with the results. Gone is the JRPG turn-based combat system. You now have to partake in essentially horde/wave battles, something I think fits the Persona series quite well. You get to wreak loads of havoc, unleashing powerful and swift attacks onto oncoming hoards of mindless shadows. I especially love how time freezes when you're using your personas, it gives you plenty of time to plan out your attacks and make sure you utilise the best skills possible. I really like the new combat system and honestly believe the Persona series should utilise this going forward. Showtime attacks are also a feature (I think I may prefer the Royal showtime attacks however), they don't do much damage initially to bosses later in the game, however there is a bond skill that increases the amount of damage that showtime attacks does (something I seriously recommend you invest your points in).\n\nNew Characters: I know for a fact I'm not the only one who wishes this game followed Royal's timeline rather than vanilla's, but the absence of Akechi and Sumire are made up for with the two new party members of this game: Sophia and Zenkichi. I can say without a doubt, these two characters are great additions, they're so comedic and powerful additions to the Phantom Thieves. If I'm being honest, I prefer how these two characters were handled and implemented into the story rather than how Atlus dropped the ball with Sumire in Royal. They flow really well into the story and their eventual arcs are intriguing all the way. Not to mention they provide a unique sense of freshness for the already established cast. All the characters work well off each other and you can tell they've grown even closer during Joker's six month absence. Sophia is a more cutesy addition whereas Zenkichi is the more comedic addition. As I have previously mentioned, both new characters are fantastic additions to the PT cast and I hope to see them return in an eventual Persona 5 Arena game or even another P5 related spin-off.\n\nCons: Unfortunately, no game is absolutely perfect, this game does have some striking (no pun intended) issues. The game crashed for me around three times in total, mainly during the end of the second jail, specifically when I had finished the trauma cell (so just be careful about that as you may experience this issue for yourself and lose some progress). Next is an issue where some of the keys decided to stop functioning. There is a simple fix for this issue: simply just press the windows key and go out the game and go right back in. Even though this was easy to fix, it was still a hindrance, especially as it happened during the final boss! Although this isn't an issue that has affected me, some people are reporting that some of the characters voice's differ in audio quality, I personally couldn't tell the difference and thought the audio sounded perfect for everyone. I do understand some people may be able to tell considering the voice lines were recorded at the actor's homes using a kit provided to them. But like I said, I couldn't tell the difference so it doesn't effect me.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Finally, I bought the digital deluxe edition of this game so I could play it early, and my playtime ended in a whopping 60:04 hours. It took me a little longer than maybe some other players as I decided to really focus on the side requests/activities. I fought many bosses multiple times to grind for money and xp (I recommend the Seth fight if you want to farm an easy 10k xp) and just really focused on the requests (something I never expected I'd do). I also spent a lot of my time going for most of the achievements, some are locked behind Post-Game and NG+. I managed to get most achievements I wanted and they were actually fun to get, none of them were too annoying and required a lot of patience to get. So I'm sure trophy hunters will be pleased to here this. The story is phenomenal and really is Persona 5 2, I cannot recommend this game enough to existing Persona fans and newcomers to the series, if you want to experience something P5 related but can't get any of the main games, GET THIS ONE! It's such a joy to play thought, the characters, the world, the gameplay, and especially the music! Lyn and Lotus Juice once again knock it out of the park with the amazing songs that are in this game. I am leaving this game with some of my favourite Persona songs: songs such as Daredevil and Counterstrike are just phenomenal. If you haven't heard them yet I suggest looking them up on Youtube. I love, love, love, love this game's OST and think it's one of the best in the series (mainline and spin-offs included). If you're debating on purchasing this game, then as I die-hard Persona fan, I say go for it. Take the leap and just play this game. It's a wonderful experience. And whilst it may not be as long and as intricate as vanilla P5/Royal, it's still a fantastic experience even though it's half as long as vanilla P5. Definitely pick this game up. And I hope many more Persona games make their way to Steam so newcomers have more games to try to further push themselves into this fantastic series.\n\nScore: Pretty much expected if you've read all of my review so far but I'm going to give Persona 5 Strikers a perfect 10/10 (despite the cons I have previously listed). Please try this game if you ever get the chance it's an experience you do NOT want to miss. Thank you for reading my review and thank you to Atlus and Koei Tecmo for creating such a brilliant sequel to Persona 5.\n\n \n",

        "content": "I genuinely really like this game. It's significantly better than other Warriors styled games I've played in the past (though BOTW: Age of Calamity was just as good as this game, I'd say) and it manages to retain Persona 5's style really well despite being so different gameplay-wise. Once you get the hang of it, the battle mechanics of this game feel really fluid and satisfying to pull off, and while these types of games are known for being spammy, I think with the amount of variety between each playable character and the varied settings you encounter, the game does a really good job with not becoming stale. I think that the character interactions are fun and that the plot progression was more well developed than I was expecting out of a Warriors-type spin off. It really felt like I was playing Persona 5 and the only thing that was different was how I hit things.\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game (a reason I'm gladly willing to change my recommendation for if fixed in the future) is because it crashes and softlocks itself far often. I've made an obsessive habit of saving after literally every small action I take because every time this game has to load something in, there's an unnecessarily high possibility of it crashing. At the time of this review, I have about 35 hours in this game (end of the 5th jail) and I was having a really good time with it, until I reached a point after a boss fight where loading in from the metaverse softlocks the game. I know it hasn't crashed because the game still responds if the controller is disconnected, but I'm otherwise met with a black screen I cannot hope to progress from. From the research I did into this issue, it seems my computer isn't the only one softlocking at that exact point in the game.\nI implore Atlus/ Koei-Tecmo to patch the game so that the PC port is actually functional, because I think it's a real shame they let this great game be released while this broken.",

        "content": "Despite having some criticism of the game, overall I'm having a lot of fun playing it.\n\nGoing into the game I heard it was a cross between Dynasty Warriors and Persona. Playing it feels like neither.\n\nCombat itself is similar to Dynasty Warriors but lacks the feeling of big epic battles. Instead of large scale battles you have fixed encounters as if you were exploring a palace in persona 5. The combat is supposed to be fast paced but a lot of the time you end up opening menus to cast spells or switch your persona.\n\nA lot of what you'd expect in a Persona game is here but parts of it feel empty and missing. You have most the systems you'd except like fusing and elemental weakness and resistances however there are no social links. In fact there's not much socializing at all in this game.\n\nThere's a bond meter with the Phantom Thieves as you play through the game and clear side quests but that's about it. If you were hoping to see a large cast of returning characters it's a bit disappointing. All the Phantom Thieves are here and I did get to go for ramen with Ryuji but personally I always found the non-playable characters more interesting.\n\nOverall the game feels very Persona lite, hits a lot of what I want but is unsatisfying in some ways. If you're looking for Persona 5-2 this is not that game. If you just want to hang out with the Phantom Thieves again this game scratches that itch.",

        "content": "Can't speak on this port of the game as when it originally launched, I had frequent crashes. However, having since played the PS4 version of the game I can confidently say it is an incredible game. A true sequel to the base version of Persona 5, P5S is an absolute perfect blend of both Dynasty Warriors gameplay and Persona gameplay, in a way that I have not seen from any other \"warriors\" type cross over game to date. \n\nThough the combat system has changed entirely to a hack and slash action RPG style game, it still manages to maintain a lot of the systems that made Persona 5 what it is, such as the baton pass, Persona fusion, elemental weaknesses, one mores and even adding Showtime attacks which mimic their Persona 5 Royal counterparts. On top of this, you still have the typical Persona gameplay of wandering about various parts of Japan and spending time with your buds, as you would expect, but this time without the time constraints. \n\nAnother aspect that thoroughly impressed me was the story, though it is \"just a crossover game\" it is not treated as such and given the full seriousness and treatment of a sequel to Persona 5. With a fully fleshed out story, two fantastic party members with their own story arc and all the character development from P5 that makes Morgana a bearable addition to the cast now! \n\nYou get the full on Persona experience and the full on Dynasty Warriors experience with this game, the best of both worlds with no shortage on either of them. So if you're a fan of either game, I highly recommend this game. The only thing I will say is go play Persona 5 Royal first, as you will lose a lot if you haven't played that game first.",

A non-turn-based Persona game is something I didn't know I wanted, but something I absolutely needed. Being able to just go nuts and fight through hordes of enemies is satisfying in a way. The Dire Shadows are a nice challenge to overcome, unless you're like me who forgot they existed until the final boss and cheesed most of them. The requests section is also a nice feature, just going after small goals for small or helpful rewards that you can just choose to completely ignore if you're on a time crunch or just hate having fun. I like being able to re-fight bosses but I am still upset that you can't re-fight Cognitive-Joker. Like every warriors game though, your AI party members suck ass, but that's to be completely expected. They do what they need to do so you can go ham on the enemies and not have to constantly worry about yourself. Until you get into late-game or are underlevelled/powered, then that's just on you.

I kinda miss the turn based combat but other than that the game is extremely enjoyable and tops it off with another great story shaped by the commendable voice actors.",

(Recommended in general but not on steam. No idea if beasts of a PC would be better. I have a 1070 and probably didn't help that I was streaming it)\n\nOverall so far, I'm liking that time isn't restricted in this game. It goes by progression. Stamina (pretty much the SP) can drain pretty quick so going to checkpoints or the entrance of the metaverse will help a lot. Leave, shop if you need to, go back, all healed up. Music is great and gameplay seems alright depending on the characters you use with their different attack combos. Seeing \"show time\" and all out attacks in real time is a pretty neat thing to look at too.",

I really hope Atlus continues on this path for the Persona series. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy turn based as much as any fan of that combat system, but having free range of movement while also being able to still obtain new persona's, summon current persona's, has been a great way to enjoy combat scenarios. \n\nLike any JRPG there is some repetitiveness, but I don't mind that, and I honestly don't think any fan of JRPG's should, as this is something we've done for however many years we've (fans of JRPG's) been fans of this genre. I'm enjoying the story, and I've basically put every game on the shelf until I complete this. \n\nI won't go into depth detail, because frankly, I'm not great at that. What I can do is give you my recommendation for this game tho. I am not disappointed with my purchase, and I can't wait to see how it ends. So happy to have the Phantom Thieves back with a new game.\n\n-Phantom Thief Shinya",

It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves in a manner perhaps even more stylish than the original game.  You get to bond with each of your team mates, engage in various side quests, go on excursions, fight to soul-stirring music (at 60FPS), and take on a threat to the world as you go on a road trip around Japan.  What's not to like?  Unfortunately, as of this writing (in early March 2021), the game is plagued by persistent crashing on my system accompanied by occasional random slowdowns.  I save every change I get so I won't lose progress.  Hopefully they'll get these kinks worked out because I love this game.",

The game will probably make less sense for people who aren't familiar with the original Persona 5, but the gameplay is still solid regardless. \n\nThere are a lot of QoL changes made in Strikers that just weren't there in the original Persona 5, some to accommodate the new Dynasty-Warriors type combat, while others are just generally nice changes (such as no punishment for returning to the real world from the Metaverse). \n\nOverall if you've played the original Persona 5 and don't mind the switchup in the core combat loop, I highly recommend this game. If you haven't played the original Persona 5, you can still enjoy this game for what it's worth but you may miss out on references made to the original game.",

        "content": "I only have one question. WHY IS THIS IN THE P5 TIMELINE? I'm genuinely curious why P5R isn't the canonical timeline. If you wanna see your favorite gymnast waifu, and edgey the hedgey detective friend I'm sorry to disappoint. She doesn't exist, and he's still dead the end. Also, there's no social aspect to the game no stats, no confidants, nough problem? \nNow speed round\nStory good, but ending is...similar to persona 5's end.\nCombat is good, but easily broken with 99 luck and mudo/hama with a mudo/hama boost. At least for mobs.\nNo romance... HOW DARE YOU!!!\nCharacter well Ryuji must have joined the navy because he's cursin like a sailor otherwise new characters are fine, and old characters are consistent.\nGame overall? Well i think it's a  fun concept that needs more polish. I would enjoy seeing another game like this more in line with the classic confidant system, some better \"levels/dungeons\", and be a little more polished combat wise.\nShould you buy this game? Yes, if you're fine with royal not being a thing, turn based combat being booted, and no confidant/social/romance system. It is a genuine good time, and i would recommend it.",

Baton passes, 1 more attacks and all out attacks are all still there, even fusing new personas and collecting them from combat.\n\nOverall if you enjoyed Persona 5 and/or Persona 5 Royal (this is a sequel to just base 5 though i believe), its well worth a buy if you don't like musou style games maybe wait till it goes on sale and give it a try, I'm having a blast so far.",

In some ways, it's like Final Fantasy 15 but less brokey and more combat.\n\nThis game is incredibly similar to the original game when it comes to story structure. Unfortunately, this one manages to be even more predictable, but I still liked the story, even though it had some low-low moments. ( that bath scene was sad )\n\nUnfortunately, if you haven't played the original persona 5 or the royal version of it, you will not understand why these characters are important. In addition, you will, of course, receive spoilers for the original game.\n\nThe combat is fun, but you won't find DMC 5 levels of depth to it. That's fine, but the problem lies with the fact that, the combat becomes boring halfway through.\nMeaning that if the game was shorter it would fit better or if the game had more to its combat it would fit the length of the game better.\n\nThis PC port comes with a few problems that we've had since day one, the best example being the very first load screen.\nWhatever the reason, it takes a very long time to load in and sometimes it never happens.\n\n\nThis game is fine, but wait for a sale, also I highly recommend you stay away from it if you never played the original game.",

        "content": "[h1]Persona 5 Strikers is a good game[/h1]\n[h1]But wait for a sale[/h1]\n\n[u]Pros:[/u]\n- All original voices are back (at least in English).\n- New characters are good and feel natural to the P5 world.\n- Persona collecting somehow still works despite the change in the combat mechanics.\n- New locations and dungeons look great.\n- Story doesn't completely suck despite it being a spinoff game.\n- Zenkichi is best girl\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Strikers a lot. The characters talking with each other felt as natural as it did in 5/Royal. Having the gang travel Japan was also a good decision, as it meant not being stuck in Tokyo the entire time (which they could've very easily done if they wanted).\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n-From a story standpoint, Royal is never mentioned. At all. Also, all non-party confidants (except three) never appear in the game.\n-Game reminds you of romances, but doesn't actually care what you chose.\n-Game doesn't do a good job of encouraging you to switch up party members, but still forces some party members in some select fights.\n-Game isn't difficult (especially if you find the right item/bond build that allows you to mow over anything in the game).\n-Lack of combo depth.\n-Music is mostly P5 ost remixes with some new stuff (and overall, not as good as the original).\n-Where is Igor?\n-Play with a controller.\n-Story doesn't understand it's own universe's rules.\n\nTo expand upon the last point, there are two times the game contradicts their own rules. First, in the first dungeon, it's shown that, besides the party, people enter the Jails as their shadows. However, the game breaks this rule several times, and doesn't explain why.\nThe second major gaffe: Morgana mentions at the very end of the game that its the \"surprise of receiving a calling card\" that causes Desires to manifest, similar to Treasures. This is just a flat wrong explanation of how the calling cards work from both P5/Royal, as well as from the same game.\n\nAs to the other points, the combat is basic and easy, and there are ways to break it (hint: Two things break shields. weaknesses and criticals) which makes combat a joke. I used Yusuke the entire game and wasn't really punished for it, which shouldn't be ok in a game that emphasized elemental affinities.\n\nIf you can get over these somewhat minor gripes, the game is fun. I would only recommend it if it gets a price cut or sale though.",

        "content": "After a whole playthrough of the game, I can say that I really enjoyed P5S. There were some flaws, of course, but for the most part, it was nice to see the Phantom Thieves back in action.\n\nHere's some Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n-Remixed music, including new tracks with vocals by Lyn Inaizumi\n-Dual Audio (It's there if you want it. I'll stick with muh English)\n-Familiar stylish UI\n-Personas' properties (weaknesses/strengths/etc) are the same\n-The game is a sequel and makes references to P5 Vanilla (Royal's 3rd Semester was not canon)\n-The \"musou\" combat is delegated to a per-encounter basis. Ambush/Get detected by a wandering shadow, then more shadows pop out in a closed off area. Defeat, then move on.\n-Stealth in a musou game. Who'd a thunk it?\n-This game is Persona first, Musou second.\n\nSome things to note:\n-Game has a tendency to crash on loading screens (possibly due to DRM)\n-Due to it being a sequel, it will contain some spoilers for P5\n-Since P5R was not canon, Kasumi is not playable\n-Story can also seem a bit underwhelming compared to 5, and not as long\n-The DLC Personas of 5 are, of course, missing (they were DLC, of course)\n-No social links [Replaced by Bond System. This gives you access to an array of perks, kind of like talents]\n-Must beat game first to unlock Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal battle themes (\"Last Surprise\"/\"Take Over\"), unlike the methods for Switch/PS4\n-The system for jumping to pillars, chandeliers, etc is a bit awkward and can catch you mid-combo\n-If the English voice track feels blemished or sounds off, the VAs recorded out of studio during the pandemic. It sounded fine to me with headphones on.\n\nThat said, most of the Cons are mild gripes. Except the crashing, but I blame that more on the DRM than I do the game.\n\nBut if you really want to see what the Thieves are like in action combat (which was pretty fitting for the cast), give it a try.",

        "content": "I would say an 8.5/10. Great game, but I've had my own wave of emotions playing it.\n\nIn my opinion, the game plays almost nothing like a normal musuo game. This is *very* Persona feeling, it's just not turned based. Taking advantage of elemental weakness is still EXTREMELY important (like every persona game) and I find myself rarely combo-ing normal enemies and only using it during bosses. Once you have SP items available the combat feels more like Persona 5 completely. Combo-ing becomes near useless.\n\nMy thoughts on the story and dungeon designs, I think the first half of the game is considerably better than the end half. There's some depth that is skipped for the last half of the game that makes me feel like things were rushed, or it felt like they had to piece things together in the middle, like they knew what they wanted but needed something there. Especially the final area, it felt SUPER short if you compared it to the first or second. It surprised me how fast I got to the final boss.\n\nI don't know what people mean, I've only ever crashed once while playing the entire game. If you're crashing that often I honestly think your computer just can't handle the game? The game is well optimized in my opinion. The only other issue I had was my controller while playing registered A B and X all as the same input. I had to assign my controller on steam and that fixed it.",

I cannot tell you where to get the denuvoless .exe however but after applying the exe, it brings the exe size down from 331,000kb to only 38,000kb and might fix some technical issues for you.\n\nall in all, fun game.",

Story is not as good as the original persona 5 or persona 5 royal, but it absolutely has it's moments. Only problem is the lack of personas - all the iconic endgame ones from the previous entries are noticeably missing. \n\nIf you haven't played a persona game before, don't jump into this as your first one. Trust me. Start with P4G, and by the time you beat that, P5R should have made it's way to pc(Sega has basically already said it will happen).

P5S prioritised the combat, rather then the social aspects of the game and broke the tradition of Persona by giving it an Hack n Slash styled combat system - and it worked well. It feels different in a good way but it still feels like Persona 5 with weapons and personas, fusions, items etc.\n\nThe story was just as good as Persona 5 and it was the perfect addition to the Persona 5 storyline.\n\nTo whether your an Persona 5 fan, or just starting the series, the game is for you but I highly recommend you play Persona 5 first anyway to understand the lore about the cognition, characters, etc.",

Use every opportunity to save \u2014 save at every checkpoint, and save every time you have free time.\n\nOther than that, this game is fantastic. I've only [i]watched[/i] a playthrough of Persona 5 since I never owned a PS4 so I can't speak for how the game feels compared to P5, but I'm enjoying the hell out of this one. It might be a spin-off or a side story, but it's a good one. Instead of the usual Persona-style combat, battles are replaced with fast paced, small-scale Dynasty Warrior fights, and the battle music has been remixed to match. For everything else: the characters, the music, the style, the writing; it's all there. \n\nWell, almost. It's still a spin-off. There's no social links for example; during the free time segments, all you really do is walk around, shop for items and maybe talk to some party members for some basic dialogue, but nothing like in the main Persona games. That said, it's still an amazing game in its own right, as long as you don't expect a [i]true[/i] sequel.\n\nOf course, if you've never played or otherwise experienced Persona 5, this game will feel alienating as you're missing huge parts of the story and the characters. Here's hoping the success of this game will prompt a proper PC version of Persona 5 Royal so more people can enjoy this.",

I was concerned at first that it was going to be more musou than Persona (as in, mostly focused on the combat rather than the story), but thankfully those concerns were immediately alleviated upon booting up the game. I'm not a huge musou fan, and I don't think I've ever unlocked New Game+ in a game that required you to do a bunch of extra stuff before, but I loved this game so much that I did every single quest and every single thing to unlock New Game+. The story really draws you in, and seeing all of the characters I love so much again made me so incredibly happy. I absolutely cried during the ending credits. \n\nThe only issue I have with this game is the crashing -- I noticed it always happens for me on loading screens, and it can be extremely frustrating. Make sure you save as often as possible. Other than that, I have zero complaints. I love all of the new characters, the story, the music, the locations, the aesthetics, the cutscenes, everything. In fact, I love it so much that I started a new game immediately after completing everything in my first run! If you love Persona 5, this sequel is absolutely worth it. If you don't like musous, you can play on easy mode so you can just experience the story!\n\nNow PLEASE bring Persona 5 Royal to Steam, Atlus!!!",

So unless there's a legitimate optimization patch, which the hotfix didn't seem to help here, I suggest you go for the Switch or PS4 version instead.",

Running the game as admin, disabling fullscreen optimization, running in Windowed mode, setting the game to run in Ultra low-latency mode in the Nvidia Control panel, reverting all of the settings to \"application controlled\" in the Nvidia control panel, and uninstalling all of the DLC.\n\nThe soundtrack coming in a separate application (not MP3s I can actually load on my phone) was already a bummer, beating the 5th dungeon's boss 6 times in a row to try and get past a glitch with the game is just inexcusable. \n\n- I did get past the issue by using a separate computer. Keep an eye out for any patches that may have resolved this issue but if you don't want to fight to get the game to run properly I'd still hold out.",

For those who have not played baseline Persona 5 I would heavily recommend you do so before playing this game. P5S feels great to be back into the world of Persona alone let alone the refreshing combat that gives it a new feel and twist. The characters are the same lovable idiots we grew with through P5 and seeing them again is awesome, added with a few new people and its a fantastic dynamic. If you have played any other persona game you know the music is great and the way they personas work in this new combat feels natural. \n\nPS: Hard mode is really hard at the start and well worth the challenge if your like me and hate yourself\n\nEdit: 45 hours and I finished the game, 9.5/10 I bought it for 75$ and id happily spend that again",

And if you have the extra music pack, that just ADDS more to it. \n\nThe combat is fastpaced, and the difficulty of each encounter just becomes more fun.  (Despite... some issues)\n\nThe story in this game matches Persona 5's, as this spinoff follows the aftermath of P5S. \n\n| The Bad\n\nThe scaling of HP of basic trash mobs seems... excessively high. And that's just basically it. \n\nI am NOT a fan of how many skills that stop you from moving. Specifically, it feels like Bufu/Zio, and the certain debuffs that stun you, need to be nerfed in effectiveness. Also, FUCK YOUR COUCH, Sleep. \n\nAnd the biggest elephant in the room?\nThe crashing. \n\nYeah, no. This game has a powerful crashing fetish. \nAnd the stutters become evident in the game...\n\n\n|The Rating\n\nWhile the game has it's flaws, the characters are charming, the combat is exciting, and in general the game feels difficult without being cheap. \n\nMy rating is Four Stolen Desires out of five.",

The combination of Persona gameplay and Musou gameplay blend so well. For people who are not used to Musou game, they maybe will find a hard time to keep up with all the stuff happening on the screen.\nAlthough we can't get every aspect from Persona, i think this game has enough to satisfy me. The soundtracks are banger as usual, especially the new ones.\n \nAll in all, Persona 5 Strikers is a solid game. 9/10",

I understand that other persona spin off games the spin offs can be quite iffy, but nothing in this game really stands out. I've never played a musou game before, but it was amazing, atleast how atlus handled it and incorporated it into the persona world, I have heard it being compared to FF7 Remake's system. While I prefer the turn based system, i definitely understand why people are now calling for this to be the main fighting system in the games. And while not having the day to day life simulator aspect, there are still social events and ways the game gives control to the player in the regular world. \n\nThis deserves not to be a looked at as a sequel, but as a worthwhile 20+ hour dlc of an already 80+ hours amazing game. If your a fan of Persona games and you're reading this review, you should buy it to show Atlus that we want more of their games on PC.",

I unfortunately started with Persona 4 Golden for the PS vita (wish I played this franchise earlier) which then got me to P5 for the PS4 and now P5S for the PC. I feel pretty fancy getting to play different persona games on different platforms.\n\nOverall, if you like persona or JRPGs in general.. This is a must buy. However be warned, I do recommend playing P5 or P5R before diving into Strikers. It is an exact sequal to where P5 left off and rarely is a sequal that does benefit from playing the previous title. As P5 or P5R will introduce you to each character traditionally which makes the inside jokes and connection to each character that much more meaningful.",

        "content": "Amazing game.  With the story, voice acting, cut-scenes and more, it feels closer to a Persona 5 sequel than a standard Mousou game, especially compared to most of the Warriors' crossovers.  The combat is engaging and carries a lot of the Persona feeling considering the fast-paced action style.  Very happy with it; very occasional random crashes can get really irritating (especially on Merciless now) but it's the only bug I've experienced, and is otherwise a solid game.  Hopefully they can find and squash it :)",

        "content": "Another PC port from ATLUS! It's always great to see!\n\nPersona 5 Strikers is a really unique spin on the Persona series. It takes the awesome world and characters of Persona 5 and mashes it with a real time combat system similar to the Hyrule Warriors series. I came into this game thinking I would be spamming my primary attack button to win, but was pleasantly surprised that it is far more diverse and dynamic than that. The way they crossed the Persona fusion system with all the Persona abilities with the Warriors battle system works so well and makes it way more engaging.\n\nWhile I have not completed the entire story yet, what I have seen so far makes me feel like I never stopped playing Persona 5. The characters' stories and the voice acting is still the same greatness from Persona 5 and it really almost feels like a true sequel to the game. Definitely would recommend to anyone who has played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal.\n\nMy only gripe with this game.. is the PC Port. Unfortunately, Koei Tecmo was involved in the development of this game, meaning the PC Port is definitely gonna have some issues. For one, the game is capped to 60 FPS, which is an improvement compared to Persona 5 Royal's 30 fps, it is definitely disappointing there isn't a way to uncap the frame rate like in ATLUS's port of Persona 4 Golden. The anti-aliasing is also very lazy and makes the in-game menus look very blurry, and the character models will also look very aliasied unless you turn the Resolution Scale up to 2.0 (in my experience). The game still runs great, but the port itself still feels pretty lazy and feels like they didn't even try to adjust it for the PC like they did with Persona 4 Golden.",

        "content": "After eight hours of play I experienced my first crash. This reset *roughly* twenty minutes of dialogue / cutscenes but I figured this was a good time to detail my first impressions.\n\nEverything from here on can contain a spoiler, read the TL;DR if you want.\n\nIf you have experience with FF: XIII or Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home. The majority of the combat is face-paced, hack'n'slash gameplay that feels enjoyably intense. While not up to Devil May Cry levels of complexity, the fights are very fun. Team member selection is vital to not getting teamwiped, even at the early levels, typical for an Atlus game.\n\nI think this game was designed for a controller in mind, if you have one: play with it. Otherwise, I highly recommend rebinding almost every default combat / interaction key in the game. While initially frustrating, like most games on PC, a good keybinding setup is the first skill in any game. \n\nIf you're new to the genre or Atlus games, don't be afraid to play on easy. I don't claim to be an expert to these type of games but, as a very competitive individual, I did get sent back to the loading screen more than once before completing the first dungeon on normal. Don't expect to be a god at this game if you have limited to no experience w/ the combat of other Atlus games. As is usual of this brand: the skill ceiling is high, the floor is rock bottom. And, trust me, the game is trying to make you experience rock bottom.\n\nAs for sound, top notch. The music has caused me, more than once, to sit back in my chair and take my hands of the controls. Some tracks are nostalgic from P5; others completely new. Each it's own an experience worth noting. The voice acting is solid. It really helps engross you in the story that would, otherwise, be boring to read.\n\nGraphics are what I expected: anime. The cutscenes are well done w/ a mix of 2D and 3D animation. I want to make a note: I am not a fan of 3D modeling / animation BUT it's done well. The combat feels fun and looks great.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSound: 10/10 - The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting engrossing\nGraphics: 9/10 - I don't have a problem w/ 60fps and graphics that come straight from PS4. Feels Persona 5, man.\nGameplay: 9/10 - High learning curve. Can be very punishing but rewards good strategy. Initial keybindings are T R A S H.\n\nI experienced my first game crash an hour before writing this review. This game has bugs.\nRegardless, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic, fast-paced hack'n'slash games.\n\nEdit: 34 hours and still playing. Suffered another crash that reset me the final 1/3 of a dungeon. Another 30 minute setback; nothing major. Frustrating, but both of my game crashes occurred after extended sessions (6+ hours). Rereading my initial impressions: all of them still have merit. My gut tells me I'm entering the final stages of the story. I'll give my final thoughts when I finish.",

The game seems unfinished for steam and not worth your money, Get it on a console and hopefully it'll actually be a finished game\n\nEDIT: after putting in 30 hours the review still stands.

I like the way they blended Persona gameplay elements with Dynasty Warriors gameplay, it works really well so you can't just spam attack or just personas. They also encourage you to take your time and try out every party member and not use just Joker as there is no deadlines either.\n\nI 100%ed the game and it took me about 44 hours to do so and I didn't rush through the game either so I'd say that's a good amount if you wanted more Persona 5 content.\n\n",

        "content": "As a fan of Persona 4 and 5, i cannot recommend this. Yes, it is more of a Persona game than just a musou slasher, it has lovable characters, some sort of a plot and the same world we all love.\n\nBut.\nThe game has a clunky combat system (And I MEAN IT, i cannot enjoy the combat after Honkai Impact, a mobile game), mediocre camera, always-tight-and-cramped combat areas, non-intiuitive dodge system that cannot guarantee a dodge, unlikeable healing system. DMG-sponge minibosses that WILL hit you back because dodge is broken.\n\nWhat's happening on the screen looks like a mess. A magnitude of monsters on the screen, flashes and damage numbers everywhere... you cannot enjoy your characters or cool combat moves because you basically see anything. \n\nI do not like the way they handled \"no time limit\" design while trying to squeeze it into the old idea of having a calendar. Basically, you can visit the dungeon as many times in a row as you like. And you do not need to visit the shops or town activities because this time you buy stuff \"online\" and there's no social progression save for a generic \"bond level\" for the whole group that gives you skill points. So, my problem with the whole thing is it's ruining the world, your impression and your affection for the game. During the time you are playing through a dungeon, you leave it to replenish HP\\SP, you appear in the Cafe with the old man Sakura standing and looking at you, then you immediately go back, manage your inventory via a menu, go to a dungeon, fight, leave, replenish, go to a dungeon, back to cafe.... all in the same day. Completely ruins the Persona mood for me.\n\nAnd all the game is feeling like it's repetative and trying to waste your time. Yeah, you get \"palaces\" again, but this time with more of a free-roam. You get your main objective at point A but it's locked and you have to visit locations B,C,D to get some shining orb and fight a miniboss. But guess what, at objective D you need to unlock the last door by ... guess what? Pulling levers E,F,G in location D.\n\nAt this point i got bored. If you like this kind of games - give it a shot.",

        "content": "This game isn't just some Dynasty Warriors reskin, it's not a Persona cashgrab, Persona 5 Strikers is a fully fledged sequel to the original Persona 5 with more than enough content to be thought of as a true persona game. After 100+ Hours in this game I can happily say this is another fantastic game by Atlus (and KT this time).\n\n[h1] MINIMAL STORY SPOILERS AHEAD[/h1]\n\n[b] Overview[/b]\nThe Phantom Thieves are back and they are prepared to journey across Japan. Strikers' world building feels great, even whist travelling from Tokyo to Sendai, Sapporo, Okinawa, Kyoto, Fu.kuoka and Osaka in the space of 1 month and exploring jails as they go. Each city looks fantastic and are all very lively, an improvement on Persona 5. Though the combat may look a little intimidating to long time Persona fans it feels more at home with the actual combat the Phantom Thieves would go through. The beginning, middle and end of the game is consistently great and Atlus & KT gave a masterpiece such as Persona 5 a sequel it deserved.\n\n[b] Gameplay[/b]\nThis time around the Phantom Thieves are tasked at exploring Jails across Japan, city-sized palaces ruled by some of the most powerful people in Japan. To fit the combat of Strikers, Jails are much larger than Palaces found in Persona 5 but are still filled with small details the can really grab your eye. A lot of enjoyment can be gained from just running around these Jails and mopping up shadows just for fun. \nAs I mentioned before the combat is rather different than your traditional SMT or Persona game, but the most pivotal mechanics are still used in Strikers. Every Phantom Thief has their original personas and skills but all have a unique playstyle for you to experience and decide on your 'main'. Joker still has his wildcard ability, but due to the lack of Igor in the velvet room he only has access to half the personas available in Persona 5. Their different weapons and guns make for a whole new experience depending on who you use, and their weapon actually changes in their hand if you buy a new one.\n[list]\n[*] [b] Joker[/b] - Access to all elements, fast attacks and an all-around beginners character\n[*] [b] Ryuji[/b] - Electric user, Slower bat attacks but do much more damage, focus on Physical skills and tanking\n[*] [b] Ann[/b] - Fire user, Fast whip attacks and fastest gun (Sub-Machine gun), focus on magic skills\n[*] [b] Morgana[/b] - Wind user, Fast sword attacks with a lot or aerial usage, mainly a healer\n[*] [b] Yusuke[/b] - Ice user, Normal sword attacks but with flurry combos, crit monster, focus on Physical attacks\n[*] [b] Makoto[/b] - Nuclear user, Normal fist attacks, all around nuclear powerhouse, an all-around character\n[*] [b] Futaba[/b] - Navigator, non-playable but can provide buffs, healing and protection for the team.\n[*] [b] Haru[/b] - Psy user, Very slow axe attacks but with very high damage, focus on gun attacks and combo skills\n[*] [b] Sophia[/b] - Bless user, Fast Yo-yo attacks with a Rhythm mechanic, high-skill based character but can be used as a healer[/list]\n\n[b] Overworld[/b]\nThe lack of 'daily life' of this game may put off a few from picking this game up, but the amount of interaction in the overworld decently makes up for it's absence. Every city has many NPCs to interact with and all shopkeepers have their own dialogue (and there are a lot of shops). After progression in the story the Phantom Thieves may be standing around town with dialogue of their own [strike] unfortunately it is not voiced[/strike]. They may also hand you requests which furthers the level of interaction you get from your long time allies. Every city looks vastly different from the next with their very own top tier theme, which really helps set each city apart from another. \n\n[b] Music[/b]\nC'mon, it's a Persona game, you should know by now that is has fantastic music, and this game is certainly no exception. From the opening theme all the way till the credits song, in my opinion there is no bad or even mediocre track in the entire soundtrack. Every song fits the theme it requires and makes you want to explore each area in depth just to listen to the smooth Jazz. Speaking of which, p5's Jazz theme has not disappeared, though there is a bit of a metal theme for the more intense battles, which fits the high paced combat perfectly. It's another fantastic job by Shoji Meguro, Lyn, and the whole Atlus sound team.\n\n[b] Graphics and Performance[/b]\nStrikers is a pretty good looking game, the art style of Persona 5 compliments the gameplay of Strikers, using the bold lines and bright colours doesn't get you lost in the fast-paced gameplay. The menu's are the best Persona has ever done, with smooth transitions and every character having a cameo in different sections of the menu. Unfortunately this game was also developed for the switch, which limited how far they could take the graphical aspect of the game. Also this PC port is not the greatest, the cause is unknown but on some systems certain cutscenes will crash the game if viewed in fullscreen. It isn't very well optimised either, enemies will lag out the game using Agidyne, and text looks grainy due to Anti-Aliasing. Overall this doesn't effect the experience too much but it is something to keep in mind if you are debating between buying Strikers on PC or PS4\n\n[b] Story[/b]\nThis is where Persona 5 Strikers really surprised me, as a spinoff I expected a toned down story filled with fanservice to keep the players happy but no. Strikers has a very 'persona-like' story, without the social links. Without a need to build characters (except the few new introductions) Atlus was able to fully focus on the story and make it great from the beginning until the end. The story starts a little weak but really picks up and is definitely on the level of a mainline Persona game story. Each new character fits perfectly into the story and each have their own role to play.\n\n[b] Characters[/b]\nSince this is a sequel to Persona 5 and not Royal, this game does lack Kasumi and any mention of Maruki, but the rest of the Phantom Thieves make their appearance with a new ally - Sophia, a sketchy detective -Zenkichi Hasegawa and an upbeat woman of tech - Kuon Ichinose.\nSophia is 'Humanity's Companion,' an AI Joker discovers in the depths of a Jail. Her main derivative is to learn, as she lost her memory after being dumped into this jail. She accompanies the Phantom Thieves in their trip, inside Joker's phone.  She's bright and bubbly and quite similar to Aigis from Persona 3.\nZenkichi is an employee of Public Security and has been tasked in researching the 'change of heart' epidemic that has swept across Japan. He may be a friend or foe but one thing is for sure, he'll be on your tail this whole trip.\nIchinose is a quirky tech guru that just loves her coding. She just happens to come across the Phantom Thieves and is a HUGE fan. She happily starts working with them to find the true culprit changing these hearts.\n\n[b] Final Thoughts[/b]\nPersona 5 Strikers is a great game to pick up if you're a fan of Persona or hack n slash musou games in general. There is over 100 hours worth of gameplay (including postgame) and it never gets stale. Merciless provides a great challenge in New Game+ and lets you listen to the amazing soundtrack even more.\n\n[h1] FINAL SCORE: 9.1/10[/h1]",

        "content": "[h1] Is this game any good? [/h1]\n\nShort Answer: Yes\n\nLong Answer: Holy crap, the game starts out strong and reels you in with a strong start. The music, the visuals, and the combat.\n\n[b] The Combat [/b]\n\nThe combat is fun, all characters have their strengths and weaknesses. While some characters might be useful against certain types of enemies, they could also be vulnerable to other types of enemies. Every character also has their own unique moveset and combo list. \n\n[b] The Music [/b] \n\nThe music is beautiful, the combat themes, the city themes, the Jail/Dungeon themes. Most games always have an outstanding OST, but they are mainly grounded to big scenarios like boss fights, or alike. However, in this game the music is always charming and the smaller tracks are just as good as the bigger tracks.\n\n[b] The Issues [/b]\n\nThere is not much to complain about though there are a few mishaps.\nFor starters, there are a few times where the game crashes and since this game functions on a checkpoint and manual save system it is a bit distressing having to replay an a chunk of the game due to the game crashing.\n\nAlso a tiny thing is how every time you begin a battle the combat theme will begin playing, but as soon as you finish the fight and get into another the combat theme will play again from the beginning. Though this isn't all too annoying since this game is a spin off from the Persona series where having to hear the same combat theme is something that always happens, which makes this problem a minor one.\n\n[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]\n\n[b] Zenkichi best girl [/b]",

The Dynasty Warriors combat mechanics work surprisingly well with the Persona conventions you're used to, so adjusting to this gameplay style is easier than you think. Each character is interesting and fun to play with in their own way, and you're properly incentivized to use all of them in different compositions throughout the game.\n\nAside from the combat, the rest of the game is familiar territory: Good story, great voice acting and character dynamics, excellent new music (and fantastic mixes on existing tracks), and a few cool surprises. Despite its nature as a genre and studio crossover, this is a genuine Persona game.\n\nIf you're [i] not [/i] a Persona fan already, this one might be a difficult game to sell you on. It's a follow-up with a very involved story that demands knowledge of the original to fully understand. If you don't have access to Persona 5, I would greatly recommend holding off until you play that masterpiece (let's hope they port it to PC). This is a sequel and better experienced after the original; it is not a standalone game.\n\nI don't really have much to criticize here. The only minor complaint I had at all was about the frequency of tutorial interrupts toward the beginning of the game. If you're already familiar with the Persona conventions, there should be an option to prevent or skip those kind of pop-ups and show only the ones relevant to new mechanics like the combat. Especially since the majority of players of this game are likely Persona vets.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a fantastic JRPG not just because of how it tells a fantastic story with a set of loveable and memorable characters but also because of how it retains the feeling of playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal. The Phantom Thieves, The Mind Blowing Eargasm Soundtrack, the Cinematic Show time and All out Attacks, the Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal design has been also given to Persona 5 Strikers from the layout to the games menu to the animations and cut scenes to the city of Japan to the dungeon which were formally known as Palaces in the meta verse now known as Jails. The Fantastic Story exploring the Meta verse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow while life in the real world goes on as the Protagonist and the rest of the Phantom Thieves are on Summer vacation when things start to go downhill. Persona 5 Strikers is as good as a Season 2 of Persona 5 Apart from missing a few signature system such as Social Links from past Persona games.\n\nStory and Game Structure: \nPersona 5 Strikers takes place and continues the story from Persona 5, just pretend Persona 5 Royal didnt happen and i have to pretend i did not romance Yoshizawa Kasumi the new girl from Persona 5 Royal which was not in Persona 5. Persona 5 Strikers continues to explore the world of the Metaverse and the \"Inside of humanity\" also known as their Shadow. The Phantom thieves are back in action to return the desires that have been stolen to their owners while also problem solving the change of hearts not by done by them to the Citizens of Japan, while the threat of the Japanese Bureau persecuting the group looms around. Given how Persona 5 Strikers has been made to be a 2nd Season of Persona 5, it is impressive that it retains the feel and Atmosphere that Persona 5 has. \n\nThe most noteable change to Persona 5 Strikers is probably the confidance system and the velvet room, the velvet room changes make Persona 5 Strikers persona fusion much simpler but the loss of confidance system and side stories that accompany them is what diverges from what a propa Persona 5 Season 2 might be. Instead you gain bond points from fighting along side with the Phantom Thieves or real time events or cooking. While these bond points allowed me to unlock new passive skills and upgrade them, i miss hanging out with the indivisual members of the Phantom Thieves hanging out with them during free time and seeing their side  PeRsOnA-L stories. Not that i mind spending less than 10 000 hours on a Persona game but i can spend any amount of time hanging out with the Phantom thieves even if it means to stop playing other games\n\nCharacters, Soundtrack and Atmosphere:\nThroughout Persona 5 Strikers the Phantom Thieves travel to different locations not just in Japan around Tokyo but to Hokkaido and Okinawa during their summer trip plus investigations but also in the meta verse where combat takes place at. The Dugenons formally known as Palaces in Persona 5 and Royal are now known as Jails and they are large and can take hours to complete. Since the jails that you are fighting in transforms the city around you, travelling back and fourth from the Jails and the real world to stock up on items and replenish HP and SP without taking up time in the real world  from previous Persona games has been implemented in Strikers which makes. Exploring different parts of Tokyo and Japan is a lot of fun just like Persona 5 or Royal even if its for the simplest things such as stocking up on items. Both the Duengons and the Map of Persona 5 Strikers are well desgin and made to be memorable. \n\nThe fan favourite Phantom Thieves are back along side new addition Sophia (Rip Kasumi Yoshizawa from Persona 5 Royal) and i don't think there is any game that i have played that has any more memorable characters than those from the Persona 5 series, while also having different personalities they each have something that will make you fall in love with them. The voice acting and animations are also are very well done. Persona 5 Strikers sound track just like any other Persona game i have played is also mind blowing, memorable and just way too good that it gives me and Ear gasm whenever i am listening to it.\n\nCombat:\nPersona 5 Strikers introduce a totally different style in combat by making players stratagize the use of their Persona skills and other mechanics that were from Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal such as the gun mechanics and the cinematic all out attacks and Show Time attacks. Fighting in Persona 5 Strikers feels good as it feels like im playing Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal using my Persona skills but also combo-ing skills with the Phantom Thieves that i choose to play as not to mention the different personallties of each character and variety of skills and combos they have. Making use of the enemys weakness in Persona 5 Strikers and using Persona skills is also a important aspect of Persona 5 Strikers as you will want to do enough damage to their weak point to use a All out or Show time attack especially against Bosses and higher level enemys since they usually have a large health pool and can soak up a lot of damage. Every Phantom Thieve in Persona 5 Strikers is playable and they each have different fighting styles and combos you can have up to 4 members of the Phantom Thieves in your party however Joker must be in the squad no matter who you choose to have along side with him. The strategy base mechanics such as using Persona Skills switching members of your party or switching the Phantom Thieve that your are currently playing as becomes even more important or harder difficulties.\n\nPros:\n-The Story of Persona 5 Season 2\n-Retains the Feel of Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal\n-Real time combat with turn base mechanics such as Persona Skils etc while also carrying over Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal mechanincs such as Show-time attacks, Gun uasge and All out attacks etc\n-Mind Blowing Ear-gasm Soundtrack\n-Map and Duengon aka Jails Design\n-Voice Acting and Characters\n\nCons:\n-Occasional Crashes on patch 1.0\n-Unanswered answers for players yet to Play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal\n-No Confidance system\n-Slice of Life system from calander has been cut down\n\nVerdict:\nPersona 5 Strikers story is what a Persona 5 Season 2 might be making this summer vacation and road trip around Japan fun, memorable and loving for fans of Persona 5 and Royal but confusing for anyone new to it.  Persona 5 is one of my favourite JRPGS, it has a mind blowing soundtrack, its world is immersive and relatable filled with loveable and memorable characters and supporting characters alongside a really rich story. The only let down being the Confidance System and the Slice of Life Calander system from previous titles which was missing.",

As more information came out about Persona 5 Strikers (or Scramble: The Phantom Strikers as the fan base knew it before it was localized) it was revealed that it was actually a full-blown sequel to the original game in the style of an action RPG. Now, this was something I could get excited about!\n\nNow that I have finished it, I can say it is a worthy successor to one of my favorite games of all time. Sure, a lot of the social aspects are gone, but that isn't really what Strikers is about. Strikers is a hack and slash road trip for the beloved Phantom Thieves, so if you love P5's cast you'll feel right at home here. HOWEVER, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT PLAYING PERSONA 5. The game assumes you're familiar with the world of that game, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice by spoiling the plot of the original game. Seriously, either find a PS4 to play it or hold out a bit longer for a PC port.\n\nAs for the game itself, I found it plays more like Kingdom Hearts than Dynasty Warriors. The combat is fluid and brain-numbingly fun. Each character has unique quirks that make them exciting and fun to play as. Being able to switch between them at a moment's notice makes the combat constantly feel fresh. My only real complaint about the game is that some of the dungeons feel a little hollow, and I think the story leans too heavily into the themes of the first game. Atlus had the opportunity to do something really interesting here, and they do with the addition of some new characters. But a lot of the plot, especially near the end, feels like a retread.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of Persona 5 this is a must-buy. If not, go play the original game and come back to this. I promise you, the style, characters, and story of these games are so instantly loveable and well worth the time sink.\n\nUntil next time, Phantom Thieves.\n\n8/10",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is a new take on the Persona formula with all new combat and cooking, Coming from my 5th favorite game of all time (Persona 5 Royal) i took a gander into experience the Phantom Thieves \"one last time\" and with this installment. It was fun, that's all i really have to say because there's not much to talk about because this feels like a sequel but at the same time it doesn't in a way where it feels like a different timeline, but what this game really shares is its moments no really big plot twists or story arks it just feels like a extended episode of a cancelled show but overall i really enjoyed this fun road trip with the gang even know there's two missing from it. I guess you could say it was a nice revisit to P5's world again.\n\n7/10       - ATLUS please Remake some of the Persona games",

The gameplay is a ton of fun with a lot of personas to mess around with. Music is fantastic as always expected with smt and persona games. Not much could be changed to make this game play better, but on the technical side the game does tend to crash a lot past the first jail, crashing like every 5 loading screens, but that might just be something with my computer. This game is definitely worth the $60 price tag, and has a decent amount of replayability, with a ng+ and an extra difficulty.",

Finally, Persona 5 strikers does have a con for me at least from the first 6 hours and this is that the level design is very bland but the design of the palace is great as always in persona games from the first palace but of course this could be subject to change as I get further into the game other than that I'd recommend Persona 5 Strikers.",

        "content": "A really great game definitely worth your time.\n\nAt first glance it seems like a Warriors-style game but truly it's not that simple, in fact it's far more accurate to say it's alike Persona 5 but with the turn based battles changed for action rpg style combat. \nDon't come in expecting to be able to just button spam your way through battles, you're going to need strategy to defeat what comes in your way, and that's playing on Normal difficulty too. \n\nAs for the story it's honestly great, I got this game expecting it to be some minor side thing and I got essentially a sequel game with it's own great story. It doesn't quite reach the level of Persona 5's story, but it's still up there on the story tiers. \n\nThe new music tracks in the game are also fantastic, including adding probably my most favourite new battle theme in the Persona series to date. [spoiler]Counter Strike[/spoiler]\n\nIt does seem to have some issues of crashing between load zones rarely and bouts of lag in cutscenes or large areas that tear the audio, though my processor is lower than minimum required so that may be more a me problem than the game. \n\nDespite those problems, I have thoroughly enjoyed what this game has offered. And as of now still have more content to finish up on it. [i]~34 hours of in-game playtime, many of my steam-tracked hours are idling with game on background.[/i]",

The combat feels fluid and the story is very engrossing, combined with well written characters I can say that I would recommend this game to anyone who has finished Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal; it's really just a fun experience over all.",

Don't believe me? check out the page for bugs on steam, and I'm talking about peeps with high end tech that their playing it on, having constant crashes. its ridiculous. and my 7.6 hours of play time? at least four of those hours where spent with just trying to retrace everything i just did in the palace before the last crash, and then id get a little further,  just for it to crash again. wait to buy this product until they resolve the issue of the crashing. There's no auto save in the palaces and you cant manually save whenever you want in the palaces, so unless you like doing every last thing from the last time you saved over and over again, until maybe, just maybe it doesn't crash, then yeah, go for it, get the game. Game play wise, it isn't that bad, really. Its fun, even though the combats not my favorite, but it still feels uniquely persona and that's all I really care about, same with the story, seems like a good old fashioned persona story, which I love... but please, just fix the crashes so I can figure out if the game was even worth the money I invested into it.",

I love getting to see the full cast together in more scenarios that's something that P5 felt lacking in, but here we get to have a wonderful adventure with them and 2 new interesting characters that don't hog the spotlight. It's a great game, well worth the time we had to spend waiting for it. I hope after SMT V we get same day international releases.",

        "content": "Strikers had a lot to live up to as a sequel to one of the best JRPGs of all time, but it somehow delivered. Even though it transitioned from a turn-based RPG to an action-based musou game, it still feels very much like Persona, with every gameplay staple intact. Weaknesses, technicals, elements, baton pass, and more; all wrapped up in a sexy and stylish art style and UI that's basically Persona 5's trademark. I often get bored of musou games very quickly because of it's extremely repetitive nature and simplistic combat, but Strikers does not have this problem at all since, like I mentioned, it has all of the gameplay staples you'd expect from a Persona game, which wildly varies the gameplay and always keeps you on your toes; especially if you play on higher difficulties. The SP system is also back where you can't recharge SP unless you return to the real world, or use items which are either expensive or hard to come by. This encourage you to constantly swap party members so you keep your gameplay variety fresh and entertaining (along with characters getting new passives or skills the more you play as them).\n\nThe only negatives I can really say about Strikers is that there is significantly less real-life activities to do. They are still there, and you can explore and talk to people, but the volume of stuff you can do is significantly lessened from P5. This is because you no longer have a time limit to complete your objective in the metaverse. If you never played Persona 5, this won't really mean anything to you, but to those who have played it, you probably should know that.",

        "content": "Highly recommend it. Playing Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal is not necessary to follow the story, but it does enrich the experience. The characters are fun as always - including the new ones - and the combat actually has a fair amount of depth to it. It uses a lot of the Persona from P5 in a sort of action-rpg type of way, slowing down time to allow the player to pick the correct ability. Also, each playable character has their own unique mechanics, so while you can switch freely between each character and know basically how to play them, there is definitely room to improve with them. All the characters are viable, so I found myself switching them to fit the situation.\n\nThe music is... [i]chef's kiss[/i]. \n\nThe only gripe I have about the game is the lack of social links, or rather the opportunities they offered to spend time with the characters. The Bond system is sort of the replacement here, with completing certain social activities gives points that are dropped into stat-enhancing modifiers, and the ability to unlock new modifiers by doing requests for different characters.\n\nI hope the release of this game and Persona 4 Golden on Steam are signs that Atlus will be bringing Persona 5 Royal to PC, but in the meantime this will do just fine. P5S stands on its own with a well-written story, gratifying gameplay and a reunion (or introduction) with this series' lovable thieves.\n",

        "content": "Haven't finished the game as of this review, but from what I've experienced so far this game has been a lot better than I thought it would be! I've played Personas 3-5, so hearing that Persona 5 Strikers was gonna be a Dynasty Warriors type game, a genre that I've never tried before, I was skeptical but still wanted to experience the story and see the Phantom Thieves again. Everything this game has shown off to me has put a big dumb smile on my face. The great combat system and bond point system, the returning music tracks along with new ones are always amazing, and the new characters that this game introduces are all great. If you're like me and have played Persona 5 but are on the ropes about trying this game, I highly recommend. Do be aware though, this game takes place after the events of the original Persona 5, not Royal. So don't expect there to be any references or any characters exclusive to Persona 5 Royal. I do also highly advise playing the original or Persona 5 Royal before playing this game in order to understand the Phantom Thieves more and so you're not completely confused on the story. Definitely a worthy GOTY candidate.\n\n10/10",

It feels like the same story of Persona 5 Royal, only with a different coat of paint. Some of the plot twists in the story (at least imo) can be seen coming a mile away if you pay attention. If you haven't played Persona 5 Royal, I guarantee you'll love this game's story, but if you have, just be warned that it might feel repetitive.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in my opinion is hardest in the midgame, when enemies are becoming difficult and you have to strategize to capitalize on their weaknesses as well as dodge their strong attacks. Lategame just becomes a cycle of spamming effective skills to stunlock, AOA, repeat until dead, top off SP as needed with items. I did play on the normal difficulty however, so YMMV.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nA great game in the Persona series, though not without its problems and caveats, but if you're willing to overlook them, I guarantee you that you will enjoy this game, provided you enjoy Warriors-style gameplay loops.\n\nAlso, Sophie is best girl.",

Before the sycophants are like \"Y DIDN U SAV MORE?\" The game locks you into very long periods of time where you cant save and every loading transition is like a game of Russian roulette as far as that goes. I guess it doesn't matter, they got my money anyway. Won't happen again. As far as the game itself its even more diluted SMT mechanics than typical persona games mixed with a shallow musou action game. The gang goes on a scooby-doo esque tour of japan doing what they do. It was ok, but the crashes are beyond infuriating. If you want to play a good action game play devil may cry 5. If you want to play a good SMT game then just google that shit there's like a dozen of those. I doubt this is getting patched to an acceptable state any time soon.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, the font looks like shit. Fix your UI/Font resolution scaling.",

Speaking of the combat, I really love the showtime and all-out attack mechanics! They're super extra and I love it whenever I get the chance to use one.\n\nThe plot of the game may have been a little predictable in some areas *because* it was in true Persona fashion, but it really did not feel detrimental to the game at all and it was still a very enjoyable experience regardless (and it also felt very nice to have a theory forming in your head to turn out to be true too)!\n\nAll in all, P5S really felt like a good and proper sequel game to me despite it not being in the classic Persona game format. Fun, flashy and memorable, this game is definitely going to be on my mind for a while.",

Not recommended if you can't stand a lot of dialogue however, as some sections of the game consist of upwards of 90 minutes of straight dialogue, although these are all skippable if necessary. I would recommend waiting until a bug fix patch however, as I've run into a few crashes here and there, and the game is literally unplayable after about 20-25 hours in, due to a glitch in which after defeating a certain boss the game softlocks itself. Some have been able to get past it, but I personally have tried every fix those who have played past it recommend. Other than the obvious lack of love for the PC port, the game content wise is phenomenal.\n\nTLDR: Amazing game but wait for patch as you literally cannot progress the game at a certain point due to a bug",

So when I heard that P5 was getting the musou treatment? I just had to buy it. All 29 hours I have so far, and I've only just begun the third dungeon. I love this game to death and will sing it's highest praises to anyone who will listen. My only gripe with it though is that it isn't musou enough for me, and the ambush mechanic seems a tad overpowered in this. A couple of friends have told me that bumping up the difficulty alleviates that some, but I can personally manage. I just wish we could of gotten tons of shadows on screen at once like you do in some fights instead of those you quickly ambush, push one button, and then instantly win the fight.",

It gives you a Digital Art Book, A Behind the Scenes Video, and a Soundtrack Player:\n\nDigital Art Book:\nThe digital art book was disappointing to me. It is nice to see the artwork and some concept art here and there it doesn't have any writing from the artists about what they were trying to do or the challenges they had to face in making it. This is the worst part of the package.\n\nBehind the Scenes Video:\nThe behind the scenes video is pretty much a non narrated documentary that shows how Lyn and Lotus Juice made the opening song \"You Are Stronger\". It mostly focuses on the difficulties of having a non native speaker sing english and it really shows how they are masters of their craft, so much so to where Lyn was able to find out that the reason her singing sound off was because the mic was just 2 inches too low, which is very impressive to me. I'd say if you like Behind the Scenes and Filmmakers commentaries you'll like this, however it should be really easy to find it on youtube.\n\nSoundtrack Player:\nThe soundtrack player is ok. It just feels like a standard music player with a Persona Skin layered over it. The main thing that sucks about it is that you can only listen to the tracks in this player and have to have it open in order to listen to them, no downloads. You're better off just finding the soundtrack on youtube.\n\nThe main reason for wanting to spend $10 extra dollars though would be to have the music play in game. You get some in game items that you won't care about but when you get this edition you get the battle themes of every main line persona game!... except for Persona 5 and Royal... from what I heard you have to have save data from those games in order to get those tracks... which means only Playstation players can get them. However, it is really cool hearing music like, Mass Destruction or Reach Out to the Truth play when you start combat, it even has music from Persona 1 as well which I do not know the name of but really like. If you like these tracks than its only 10 bucks and you get to pick which tracks you dont want to here and in each battle they will randomize which track you get.",

Everything we know and love from Persona 5 has been weaved into a glorious Muso-style dungeon explorer that does not disappoint.\n\nIt is pretty important to have played Persona 5's main game, or else you'll really be lost on a lot of the concepts that aren't explained for story development. This game assumes you have played the previous game already, and I admire that aspect. This truly feels like a continuation to exactly where things were left off after the main game.

But after playing more and more of it i got used to everything and honestly it was a great experience. Once everything makes sense to you it can be a fun experience, the story, and characters are the same if not better than in P5. Although the combat may be different its really fun and unique and is a great hash and slash game. If you like persona games, this is a nice spin to the originals. And if you like hash in slashes its also amazing to learn and feel the unique aspects. 7/10. It could have been better but im happy with what it came too.\n\nedit 1: after 100%. 9/10. it good game\n\nedit 2: after playing royal again, this game just humbles you in what to expect in other games. not a good persona game but a good game in general",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers was exactly what I wanted in an action Persona game. It faithfully implements mechanics from the rest of the series in an action combat form. If you play on hard mode, it's a significant challenge and much more fun, as you have to pay attention to what skills the enemies are using on screen.\n\nYou probably should play Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal first, as there's a lot of references to it that you might miss. You also won't have context on who all these characters are, as the game seems to expect you to know them already for the most part.\n\nYou might think with Koei Tecmo/Omega Force's involvement in development, that this is a musou/warriors game. It is definitely not. It's an action RPG. There are only mini-hordes of enemies, and you actually have to watch what all the little enemies are doing, as the skills they use can cripple you in an instant. You initiate combat on shadows walking around, that burst into multiple enemies. You want to try to be stealthy so you do not end up in a fight you can't win, as well as raising security level in the Jail.\n\nIf you like Persona games (or even Shin Megami Tensei games), I highly recommend checking this out. The story can be a bit nonsense sometimes, but is fun nonetheless. There is no calendar time slot system like in Persona 5. The calendar only moves on with certain story events. You can enter and exit dungeons all you want, and the day will still stay the same.",

        "content": "If you're eye-ing this game then that means a few things: you either played Persona 5/Royal and want more of that, or if you're strictly PC, you're coming from Persona 4 Golden and are curious about this game. Overall Persona 5 Strikers is a unique take on the Persona franchise, and a summary of my thoughts on it could be summed up to *almost* more of the same if you're coming from Persona 5, or a somewhat familiar but also not-so familiar experience if you're coming from Persona 4 Golden, even though this installment in the series has wildly different gameplay from both Persona 5 *and* Persona 4 Golden. Details below.\n\nBefore I talk about anything else though, discussing the story must come first, as Persona 5 Strikers is set *after* the events of the main game of Persona 5 (NOT Royal, as I believe Strikers was released in Japan before Royal debuted anywhere). Following that, naturally the experience is enhanced if you have played Persona 5 from start to finish, and a few things about the mainline title are naturally spoiled. THAT SAID, Strikers actually does a very good job of being vague to the events of Persona 5 with the least amount of spoilers possible, so you can absolutely get away with playing this without playing Persona 5 first. Just be warned that a few things *are* spoiled, so it's definitely not spoiler free.\n\nMoving right along, the plot is written very well I thought; I went into this not actually expecting much, but I came out of it pleasantly surprised. Strikers' storytelling is identical to that of Persona 5 (surprising absolutely nobody), except this time all of your party members are right there from the get go. ATLUS introduces the new characters very nicely; I was fully expecting the new characters to feel a little awkward and forced, but they quickly found their place within the rest of the cast, and by the end they felt like they belonged and have been there all along. At some points, I felt as if Strikers had even stronger story points than Persona 5.\n\nThe gameplay I thought was unique; this game is a full on hack-n-slash beat-em-up type of game, which is very different from the main titles in this franchise. A word of warning that it never really changes its combat up too much throughout the entire game, so it becomes repetitive after a while. I frequently had to take breaks because of how repetitive it can get, and I found myself thinking that taking on additional requests that you get throughout the game to be kind of a chore since there's no real variety in the requests that you get. However, what *is* there is fun; the hack and slash combined with the tried and true persona summons works very well. There are a variety of combos to remember, and each character has their own set, along with their own elemental strengths and weaknesses previously seen in Persona 5. If you've played Persona 5, the old cast will feel pretty familiar as a result. It's worth trying every character out as soon as you're able to as well, since every character plays differently as far as their combos go. Pro tip: make sure you get comfortable with a myriad of party members too. It will not only expand your tool set when confronting powerful shadows, but there's a specific part where you'll have to basically use all of them at some point.\n\nPerformance wise, this game runs very well on my GTX 1080; I didn't see a single frame drop, except for one spot in one of the dungeons which turned out to be a complete one off situation. This game is optimized well, but the only problem is that this game has a tendency to crash when loading into and out of the Metaverse. Please remember to save often, as crashing at some points could mean having to redo tough fights. I myself crashed twice at one specific section and had to play the same section three times total before I finally got through it. Those two crashes were the only crashes I had within my 45 hours of game time, however.\n\nOverall, Persona 5 Strikers is a great hack-n-slash game, and is a very good extension to Persona 5. While the gameplay can get repetitive, overall I had a lot of fun with this title and it really quenched the thirst of wanting more Persona 5 that I didn't even know I had. Highly recommended.",

The characters are fun to be around and play as, and the music is captivating in typical Persona fashion. The Warriors-style gameplay works well for Persona; if you enjoyed Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity then this is also for you. The only issue I've encountered are random crashes, but P-Team rolled out a beta hotfix that focuses on stopping that issue. So props on them for making another great game as well as working hard on squashing bugs.",

While that may seem obvious I have lost hours of progress due to the games seemingly random crashes. I have played the game for 8 hours with no issue but advance in a single mission and the game can crash. It doesn't ruin the game but mainly its just an inconvenience at most.",

The game is a lot more Persona-like than I thought, since it is a \"Warriors\"-type game, which is a nice surprise.\n\nAt the first real free exploration of the first Palace I have only a few complaints.\n\n1) The game crashed on me after about an hours worth of exploration and dialogue.\n2) The game for some reason takes AGES to load when you boot it up. (I kid you not it takes like 2 whole minutes of just loading after you launch it. Weird.)\n\nEDIT; \n\nThe current beta branch (which I am assuming the full patch will launch some time in the coming weeks) has fixed the crashing/hang ups for people. PLUS, if you're like me and were suffering from long loading times either on launch or just in general (even on an SSD) if you set the game to always run as Administrator it helps a lot, not sure why but hey it was worth mentioning if it helps anyone. :)",

        "content": "So... what is Persona 5 Strikers?\n\nShort answer it's Persona 5 the sequel with new flavors mixed in.\n\nBelow are my four key points to hopefully convince everyone who is curious, along with a few other bulletpoints.\n\nFirst and foremost, there are NO SOCIAL LINKS-now, most people would be upset by this, and yes, it is technically a loss for the series as a whole, but it's not quite as big of a deal as you'd might think. You get to interact with the party and the cutscenes you share with the Phantom Thieves are all quite cozy and just plain JRPG comfort food. \n\nSecond, this is NOT turn based combat, it's a sort of spin on Dynasty Warriors, meets active RPG, meets mild turn based mechanics. Sound messy? It is when you first jump in, but after everything is explained to you? You'll be gliding through combat like a beast. Essentially you have buttonmashing combos to take out trash, you can add some spice by changing what buttons you hit for different actions to occur. Whenever you press the \"Summon\" key (the key to actively bring out your Persona, you are given a list of spells and abilities to select from, time is halted during this. Additionally, there is gunplay, all you do is target enemies with a gun and fire at them--time slows down to like 1/8th speed during this mechanic.I will note that despite this being in the \"Dynasty Warriors\" archetype of games, I find it an unfitting description. This is still an RPG, and the boss fights DO require some strategy, if you run in mashing you will not have much success on these fights, on top of this, it feels less tiresome because you see when encounters are going to occur as opposed to your map just being flooded constantly with enemies.\n\nThird, ever wanted to play as any of the other Phantom Thieves? Guess what, that's a thing this time. In fact, it's an encouraged mechanic-the Baton Pass system in this one can help you juggle powers by switching characters when prompted-it can get nasty if done right. On top of the Baton passes, each character has a set of \"Mastery Skills\", and these were just delightful treasures, I remember each time I unlocked a new one for a character (four mastery skills per character)  I couldn't help but laugh and think \"That sounds overpowered\", oh yeah, they all felt that way-if you know how to play and use the characters skills? You'll turn into a monster on the battlefield. \n\nFourth, the freaking music. Dear god. The. Freaking. Music. This game follows the standard Persona series tradition of having music that's just outright amazing-the fact that they give you the soundtrack with this is simply amazing. I cannot endorse this game's music enough. If you've played the series previously, you know what to expect.\n\n\n\nA few other things.\n-Dynamic artstyle that looks just as flashy as always.\n-Lower system requirements, meaning some older rigs out there can run it.\n-Japanese and English voice options (both are wonderful, and all voice actors returned for their roles.)\n-Game is optimized for any controller type, I normally wouldn't think I'd have to mention this, but I just played another title that was not equipped for all controller types. \n\n\n\nI've bought a plethora of games on Steam, and done a small handful of reviews. (I owe another JRPG a review... better get on that one too.) This is one that I strongly encourage you all to purchase and play. It's a solid experience and worth your time. Ideally, this will also give Atlus the incentive they need to release all future (and perhaps previous) SMT titles on PC so I don't have to own a console for the sole purpose of their games.",

        "content": "Toughest prison to break out is in your mind\nNow, when I finished it on hard and started my merciless run I can write this rewiew\nMy Exp in Persona games consists of P4G, P5 and P5R\nSo, lets go to the diff, pros and contras\n\nFirst and the most is new combat system. It's not turnbased. Check it before buying game, and if u dont dislike it just give this game a try. It's really nice!\n\nSecond thing you may dislike is new amount of social events. \nDays in P5S don't go one by one, but change, when you progress the story. Therefore there is no time for life events and social links like in normal persona game. \n\nThird thing, that makes game not so fun is persona fusing, I completely loved the system in P5R, but here your fuses give you less then something\nYour personas can not change their combo abilities, there is no res/null/drain abilities, to give them in fusion. \nThere is no itemize, but you dont really want to have skill cards, until its passive skill\nAnd I dislike Persona Points, You just always make transition in buy fo yen/sell for points -> repeat \nI understand, that Null/Drain/Repel Yoshitsune completely breaks rules, but cmon. All this fuse circus always was about making incredible power level personas.\nHere you fuse them,you can up their stats, but all this is just to don't suck at power level and have personas default drains/nulls.\nI cant say that its minus, cos now fights are a little more about your dodges and combos, not about 1st turn hassou tobi. It's still about debilitate/Matarukaja+Masukukaja+Marakukaja, but now it's diffirent. Just give it a try\n\n+++++++++++++++\nCooking and dialogues about food are awesome\nLevels are memorable\nMusic (thanks to Lyn) is absolutely perfect, funky and took my heart\n\nI recommend to buy this game to everyone. who isn't afraid of new combat system and wants to try something new with good old friends",

        "content": "This game is a solid 6/10. \n\nI would say it's an interesting game and definitely has a cool new way of fighting. But for some reason the game is so damn boring. \n\nI think it's because I pre-ordered Persona 5 when it was first announced. Then also got the Royal version too and spent so much time on them that they are leagues better than this game. I think if your new get the original ones but if you have played them this maybe a okay DLC/Extension to the game\n\nHere is my overview: \n\nThe story is pretty much the same with weaker reasons\nThe fact that Joker feels like the weakest character \nEvery other character besides Joker feels really nice to play as my favorite is Ryuji \nThat you can't multi select or buy \nThe Persona system is more toned down\nCombat is cool at the start but very boring and repeat the same thing over and over again\nIt's like this - In a Dynasty Warriors game you fight large armies with your character but feel like a Badass. In this game when you start a fight you have to wait for a cut-scene. You're not a badass (Oddly since it's after the main game and you're basically a GOD KILLER) and the persona drops are a bit random.\nThe camera is odd when you do a spell/persona attack it doesn't reset the camera and there's no button for it to rest the camera. \nThe mini Map doesn't rotate - For me this is super annoying\nSeems like a lot of random stuff just to do the same fights over and over again \nOh and there's so many tutorial pop-ups I thought the original Persona 5\u2019s were bad but this is so much.\n",

Set to Hard mode if you want any sense of challenge.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can say that this feels like a Persona game. Story, Character, Fantastic voice acting, it's all there. I've never been a Dynasty Warriors fan because all they ever do is rehash the same thing over and over again, and it rarely has any substance. They made a terrible Fate game series, an ok Zelda series, but they finally figured something out. (Of course, Atlus was there to watch over development like a nosy teacher looking over a child doing their homework. But this teacher knows how to teach properly.)\n\nThere hasn't been any problems with the game. You know, like real games when they were released when they were ready. No EA \"We'll fix it later\" shit. \n\nHow The Game Plays: This feels like a Persona game. Let me emphasize this. The battles still have a bit of strategy to them. You can't just run blindly in (at least on Hard difficulty) and wack hack away. And for people who don't want to play a game with battle substance, or the possibility of losing, you have Normal mode. If your 6 year old brother wants to play, you got easy mode. It's perfect. They got a difficulty for all types! And you don't have to start the game over if you find out Normal doesn't cut it 2 hours into the game like I did. \n\nPersona fans will enjoy this. Dynasty Warrior fans will enjoy it. People who hate reading, plot, and character development will despise it. But I suppose if you hate reading in the first place, you probably didn't read this far.\n\nEdit: Beat the game. This is THE BEST Dynasty Warriors game. Better than Dynasty Warriors, better then Zelda, etc. I only wish Makoto would call me back....",

It has all the feels of a post persona 3 game, just condensed, but never had I got the feel that the game felt rushed.  The dungeons are built so that they don't feel repetitive (unless you're looking to 100% the game, in which case of course you'll need to go out of your way to do some side quests).

        "content": "Pros:\n- Good story, worthy of being a great sequal\n- Combat is easy enough to get used to\n- Both Japanese and English dubs do an amazing job at voicing characters\n- 60 FPS is great compared to 30FPS\n- Zenkichi and Sophia are great additions to the main cast\n- No time progression if you exit a jail, and no deadline to complete anything (aside from treasure demons)\n\nCons:\n- Random crashes, usually in cutscenes/transitions after a jail\n- Infinite loading/black screen after you beat the 5th jails boss\n- Game can only run FPS up to 60FPS\n- 3rd jails boss is a huge difficulty spike\n- Maps can sometimes be disorientating\n- Not a lot of characters from the first game reappear\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend getting this game for the great story to finish up the Phantom Thieve storyline, but only once ATLUS have fixed a lot of issues and bugs with the PC port.",

        "content": "I make this review very subjective as i played all 'Persona' titles and having a certain expectation.\n\nMainly I feel P5 Strikers lacks of Persona 5 original charm, and i was hoping with P5 Royal like expectation where Royal was extravagant but still delivers 'cool teenager' experience.\n\nI did played musou game like DW and SW, where it makes me as player feel very powerful, but it isn't when i play Strikes. Instead i feel frustrated as the enemies(especially the strong one) are very not balance until i reach 'not fun' point. Fair point i play the game in hard mode, but in Royal i played 'Merciless' difficulty in first playthrough, but it was still very doable and feel very fun. I know it's a different genre, but by holding 'Persona 5' title it should reach a same experience.\n\nP5 Strikes also feels very boring for me. It's repetitive and defeating enemies isn't satisfying. I think it's a problem in UX delivery, where in any original Persona's battle we potentially see something new like new enemy, new potential persona, new item, yada yada yada. Strikes has a contradiction design, while ambushing enemy is using same approach as Persona 5, but then every battle information is using musou game style, for example every item and new persona shown in the mid battle. How the **** i could see that in the mid of chaos, why not just using Persona 5 style T_T where everything we got is shown in the end of battle. This problem leads to I feel I don't get anything and not rewarded, heck i even often didn't know i have a new persona. Fusing a new persona is also not really that exciting, as i know i will be pummeled again by the enemy. It's unfortunate where Persona 5 main strength is UI/UX with their very awesome style.\n\nAnd lastly no Kasumi is a huge experience gap and it feels strange for me.",

        "content": "Edit: After the hotfixes the game has been error free and I can recommend this game now. It has worked on everything I have put it on lately and that's a sigh of relief. Enjoy the game! I will not delete the original review because it is important to note issues at launch.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI want to start off by saying this game is an amazing game and a full 10/10... WHEN IT WORKS! I have a beast of a PC and the game runs super well when it decides to. However the game crashes over and over again. It will do so completely randomly as well. And to me I save every chance I can get and still end up losing 20 minutes to an hour each time. of the 26 hours clocked only 17 are on my file because I have lost that much time in the game due to random crashes. \n\nMost of the crashes occur during loading screens. However I did experience one crash in the middle of dialogue and another in the menu. Again I love this game but after the 12th crash I have decided enough is enough. I will suffer the bugs and crashes to finish this game but I DO NOT suggest anybody even try this game until they fix their crashing issues. As a huge fan of the Megaten series I am severely disappointed in the lack of QA for this game. I only have thios here on steam but I have read reports of the PS4 version also crashing on PS5 so it seems the console ports have issues as well although I would imagine far less. \n\nI appreciate the challenge and old feel of a Dedicated area to save (you can only save in the real world or checkpoints in the Jails) but because of a lack of a Autosave feature the crashes have become unbearable. \n\nMy luck is terrible as it has crashed at the worst possible times for me including after an hour of gameplay that could not be saved between. An autosave would have saved me the anger from losing that. Even then I feel like I have given enough time to this game for it to not just be a one off issue.\n\nFor the love of god I hope Atlus and Sega will FIX THE CRASHES! Unacceptable!\n\nEdit: I switched from my Samsung Evo 970 Plus to my SATA Samsung QVO 860 SSD and the crashes completely stopped. I switched back and it crashed. If you have a laptop with only an NVME drive stray from this game as it bugs out with them. I still think it's the Denuvo DRM lacking support for the NVMe drivers. They need to fix this and last I checked there were no Update patches yet. If they release one I will test and update the review once again.\n\nGame is fantastic though. Just be aware that you need a Outdated ancient technology to avoid crashes. Which is still unacceptable of a positive review. Get this on PS4 instead.\n\n\nMy Specs are\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600X\nMSI X470\nNvidia RTX 2060 Super\n32GB 3600MHZ DDR4 Ram\nWindows 10 Pro\n1TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus NVME SSD\n1TB Samsung QVO 860 SATA SSD\nKingston 480GB SATA SSD\n2x 4TB 7200rpm HDDs in Raid 0\n\n(I have tested it on all storage drives and it only crashes consistently on the NVMe drive)",

I do have a few complaints, like how the ability to return from jails without time progressing making it so that HP and SP recovery items don't really have a use since you can just fully recover those by leaving and returning. Despite a few more gripes, I very much enjoy this game.",

But I can only recommend this game if your PC is capable to run it properly without issue, or if you have a PS4 and/or Nintendo Switch (which i imagine, the console versions run just as good)",

The game even has some postgame content. If you liked persona 5 and enjoy action games, this is a must play.  My only 2 big complaints with the game are that the bosses are damage sponges and the story can be pretty similar to the original at times. Overall though, I really enjoyed it and plan to continue with postgame contest and get 100%",

The story, even though it's not at the level of the prequel in my opinion, continues to expand the Persona universe and shows how much effort has been put into the development phase of this game.\n\nThere are currently a few bugs that break immersion, such as occasional game crashing, average loading times and being able to challenge the Monarch of Sapporo without sending a calling card, but nothing ridiculously game breaking that makes the game unplayable.\n\nAll in all, a perfect sequel to a perfect franchise and I can't recommend this game enough to Persona fans. All we need now is for Atlus to release Persona 5/Royal on Steam for us PC players to enjoy even more!",

Cannot recommend in it's current state\n\nEDIT: As of now, I have figured out a fix to the long loads but nothing for the crashing. If you want to fix the loading time without having to disable dlc, simply go to the local game files of the game, find the game launcher, right click on it and go into properties. Then you go to compatibility and check run program as administrator. It may not work the first time but after awhile of reloading I finally got good load times. However, crashes still plague the game. This is also a good fix for the infamous black screen after beating the fifth jail.\n\nEDIT: As of now, I beat the game and just went into New Game +, for some reason now crashes are practically non-existent and loading times being fixed all in all make the experience very enjoyable, as of now I highly recommend",

It has a lot of what i wanted in the original Persona 5, the phantom thieves acting more like friends rather than teammates, because everyone is introduced immediately, the game has freedom for you to see them acting as friends, the writing is consistently witty and actually funny and not forced, and even while going through the \"palaces\" of the game (which they are called jails now), there is so much idle and situational dialogue it genuinely feels great to see everyone interacting with each other. \n\nThe combat is smooth and slick and keeps the absolute overwhelming sense of style as in the games prior, every character has their own gimmicks and unlockable techniques if you play as them for long enough, adding something new and it never once felt as if im forcing myself through battles, when you're strong, the game makes you feel like it and its just so cool.\n\nThe story and new characters we're also very interesting and the final parts of the game felt very reminiscent of the final palace of Persona 5 Royal, which is a nice touch, you also unlock the og Persona 5 and Persona 5 royal battle music after beating the game, as well as some extra things that add replay value to the game.\n\nThe only downside is, as I'm sure you've heard, the game is not a stranger to crashing, while my game has crashed only twice, i suggest saving very often when you are playing the game since when you crash, you have to go back to your latest save file,  hopefully these problems get fixed. \n\ntldr: its a very great experience and more of the Phantom thieves we know and love, with a DRIPPY soundtrack and combat, i say it's worth the price, i cans see the love that went into this game. It can crash but the only way to remedy that for now is to just save as often as you can. A very solid experience.\n",

This feels like a nice second course and dessert to the original, that I am so glad we got.  I will post a more in depth review after completing the game",

This game was not ready for PC it's a great game but if you're one of the many people out there that can't load into the main menu then good luck the fix out there is to put into window mode but this game refuses to do window mode I literally have to watch the game exit out and launch until it goes into window mode \n\nso the fix is something you need to do yourself and do to how game studios dont like talking about inner workings but it also explains so much it got to do with nvaida and amd hopefully this will help people out or point them to the fix\n\nstill will not recommend this game till a official fix and that means everything. \n",

During gameplay, I've had to replay entire dungeons and bosses over and over again because of the constant crashing. The game runs like absolute ass and is just a poor PC port.

        "content": "Really, a amazing game that is a must buy. BUT, there is some issues that is holding back the game of its full potential, this includes, game crashes and a bit of camera problem.\n[b] P.S:[/b] i added spoiler text, be warned.\n\n[b]- Crashes:[/b] i have gotten several crashes/freezes toward my playthrough in P5S, First crash is during [spoiler] Alice's [/spoiler] jail, during this Jail, i have gotten a crash that made 3 or 4 of my first hours worthless as i did not save and had to start at the beginning where i met Sophia. Second, is a freeze,after the gang defeated [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] and leave the Jail, it suddenly froze and i wasn't even sure if it was loading or not since there was no phantom thieves Logo.\n\n[b]-camera issues:[/b] for me, the camera was a bit annoying as it started to clip through objects like trees and walls, making it hard to see. easily can copy the camera movement from other hack and slash game (dynasty warriors or god of war 1,2 or 3) but did not and feels like the camera is fighting agaisnt me.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]  the game is amazing, The story, the returning characters, the new characters, the twist, the adventure. But there are way to many problems in this current build and is holding the game back. Wait till patches and updates come out for the game if you are thinking of purchasing this game.\n\n[b] edit:[/b] also, after the [spoiler] Akane [/spoiler] boss fight, my game wouldn't load, i have restarted the game even my computer numerous times, i cannot continue onward after that, so the game is unplayable for me, please fix this issue ASAP.\n\n[b] edit 2: [/b] so, after Atlus/Sega fix the issues by giving it a more stable platform shape as a hotfix, i can finally continue the game. After finishing it, one thing is certain, it a rollercoaster of emotions and after they fix it, definitely recommend this game to Persona lovers, even thought its no longer a  J-RPG, they certainly put the effort to make the hack and slash aspect better. Now, i can finally say with certainty...i definitely Recommend this game.",

The game takes several aspects from the original Persona 5, in terms of plot points and themes. Characters like Haru Okumura gain lots more screentime than previously. The game will give you a good time guaranteed, regardless of the type of player. I highly recommend for persona fans or people who love action, RPGs or even just enjoy an anime aesthetic. There is something for everyone (if you are above the ESRB rating).",

I can't recommend picking up the PC version right now. \n\nThe reason I say that is because of the random crashes that seem to occur during loading screens. I'm currently stuck in the beginning part of the first palace where you meet a certain character, and every time the part tries to load me out of the palace it crashes and I lose all my progress as there's no way to save from that moment on, I've done this section of the game 2-3 times already and I'm afraid it will continue on into later portions of the game,\n\n8/10 honestly would be a 10/10 if not for the crashing issues.",

        "content": "Do I recommend this game? Easy answer, yes! Complicated answer, wait a little bit.\nFirst, as much as Atlas says this is a standalone title, it really isn't. As far as I gotten into the game, there were many past references to the original Persona 5 game (unfortunate how it's only on ps4/ps5 for now\u2026) If you haven't already, play the first game. Ignore royal, waste of time haha. Besides that, I would consider it a direct sequel to Persona 5. Ever play Bayonetta (a very fun game as well, totally recommend)? It's very similar to Strikers, pretty much going into the \u201chack and slash category\u201d. I would suggest you use a controller too unless you have long flexible fingers. Keybinds for keyboard are kinda all over the place, so if you have the patience unlike me, Strikers supports change of keybinds (controller still recommended). Now, performance wise\u2026. Considering that it's a new game, there are lots of random crashes, and bugs here and there which ruins the entire persona experience, which is why I believe you should wait to buy this game till a patch gets pushed out. BUT! This game is great, takes elements from its different titles and mixes them. You will definitely know it's a Persona game, because of its catchy music and cool game art esthetics. 10/10.\n",

As a Persona series fan for years now, this has been worth the wait. the continuation of the story has a very natural progression and feels smooth. \n\nThere is a Lot more voice acting in this compared to the previous and is very satisfying to listen to. It shows that the production for this game is very heartful. Meaning that Atlus believes in their game and decide to put their heart into it's developement. \n\nNow Atlus please put Persona 5 Royal on Steam.

        "content": "Just wait, guessing SEGA decided that the DRM was more important than the game stability so I have to put down the controller and hop onto P5R while what I'm guessing is the porting team fix their screw-up with the PC version that causes crashing and lengthy load times.\n\n= Do note that the community has already found workarounds to fix just about everybody's issues. I myself used the nvidia control panel fixes (plus setting the exe to run as admin) and it has completely solved the load time and load crash issues I've suffered. (as far as I can tell atleast)\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, yes even those that have already played Persona 5. First off this game is fully based on the Persona 5 Original version of the world, not the Royal remake. If this bothers you please keep in mind that this game was released in Japan long before Royal was made. Keep in mind that this game also happens after the events of P5 so I fully recommend you play P5 first unless you came here specifically for the combat system over the story, at that point you'll be fine most of the major plot points revolve around current happenings anyways, I myself came for the story so...\n\nPoint on the combat system. If you already played P5 or P5 Royal you might have issue with the combat system as it takes the, beat the life out of waves of enemies with everything you got, approach over the turn-based quality over quantity enemies that the mainline games have. The fusion system is slightly simplified as is the persona strengthening system. You are slightly screwed out of you're previous sources of items, armor, and weapons, but in turn you have and adorable new character who will handle most of your material needs. You also have Joker's awakened cooking abilities and a 100% fixed flow of time, also UNLIMITED TRANSIT between the real world and the metaverse, due to the shorter in-game time you are given to clear the palace. DAYS WILL ONLY PASS ALONGSIDE STORY PROGRESSION. No getting bad ends because you spent to long getting pestered by Mona to sleep. There is also a million other little things you'll learn as you play that differ from the mainline games but you'll learn them fairly easily.\n\nI dearly love the Persona games alongside it's older edgier cousin. And so far the game has been amazing for a spin-off of a spin-off series. You do have to look at it like persona Q in that it is fairly different from the game or games that it spawned from. Igor is once again eating popcorn far away from the side disaster probably drinking tea with his boss. So just, realize that like a lot of games, you won't know how much you'll enjoy a game till you play it or see the systems in action.",

        "content": "While this game is a great sequel to the Persona 5 storyline, the gameplay is wildly different that some players may be put off at first if they were just expecting another Persona 5.\n\nReally need to have played Persona 5 or Persona 5 Royal to understand the background of a lot of the characters and appreciate the connection a lot of them experience in the game. The story itself is pretty stand-alone, but the interactions that some of the characters experience or reference aren't.\n\nCombat itself, while intensely different from the mainline game, is quite enjoyable both from the standard attacks, various ways the different characters you can control function, the way weaknesses are handled, all the way to the All-Out Attacks not just being a 1-hit KO necessarily. All of the systems provide depth to the combat, but don't complicate it too much to allow the player to still fully master it in the course of normal gameplay.\n\nStory, Voice Acting, Music, all are Top Notch just like the mainline Persona 5 game. All are accentuated by no Confidant system being in this game like in Persona 5. While that might be a detriment in some aspects of truly getting to know some characters and having more 1-on-1 interactions between characters, it can also help keep the story going at a smooth pace with how the 'dungeons' are laid out.\n\nBoth a pro and a con at the same time in different aspects, is the fact that there is no time/day management in this game like in the Persona mainline games. This means that there's not as much planning needed for those that were hoping for that aspect. However, it also means that players can go back and truly explore and 100% the 'dungeons' and such without worry that they will miss something because they mismanaged their in-game time/dates.",

I'll leave my original review below for two reasons. First, according to other reviews, the crashes are still a major issue for some people, so I might have just gotten lucky, and people should be aware of it. Second, I think it pretty accurately expresses what I love about the game.\n\nIf they fix the crashes, this is an amazing game. If they fix the crashes, I can give this a positive review. If they fix the crashes, I can talk about how this game brings back the same feeling I had playing Persona 5. If they fix the crashes, I would recommend this to both Musou and Persona fans alike. If they fix the crashes, I can say that this actually feels like it would even appeal to people who weren't ever fans of either. Please fix the crashes, This game obviously had a lot of effort and love poured into it, especially for something that I was expecting to be a quick cash-grab. There's no reason it should have the negative reviews that it does. It truly is amazing if only it lacked the technical issues. I've only put ten hours into the game so far, and I've already had it crash twice so catastrophically that I had to restart my computer.",

        "content": "I liked the combat system in this game, the transitions into combat is much faster and enjoyable than the classic turn base mechanic in the original Persona 5. Don't get me wrong I do like that system. This game is more easy to understand and defeat enemy opponents as you get to know their weakness from the start with the third-eye ability and Futaba analysing the enemy mid & start of combat. Which makes sense since this game is based right after the original Persona 5 game. So Joker would know all enemies weakness and what persona mask he should use to strike their weakeness.\n\nWhen you have the correct characters while in the jail you can then use them to strike the enemy weakness and do massive amounts of damage, they do have environmentals attacks in sum jails that can alleviate the problem of accidentally initiating combat with characters that do not have the correct abilities to strike the enemy weakness. On the other hand, you can just max out Joker's slots with persona masks from fusion or the compendium in the velvet room, and hope he has the right mask with the right ability to strike the enemy weakness during that combat situation but that's inefficient as it would just deplete Jokers stamina making him useless, unless you pump him with items that can recover his SP.\n\nHowever, a solution they can introduce is that I would loved for them to bring back the ability to switch out characters during combat by idk a bond upgrade since they removed the social aspects from the game.\n\nAnother thing I kinda dislike is the inventory system, I hate having to pause the combat to then scroll down a ton of purchased items to find the correct item to use to for example recover SP to a character that's out of stamina. \n\nA solution they could add to fix this would be a redesign in which they categories the inventory to have HP items in one section, SP items in another and lastly the curables ailments items in different sections for quick and easy location and applying the item on said character that needs it.\n\nI will not mention story as I would like to not spoil it for any persona fan that hasn't played it but overall it a good hack and slash game and story in my opinion does seem kinda rushed but it's great.\n\nFor price, I would loved to have paid \u00a310 less but I'm still happy with my purchase. As the game is fun and enjoyable. As well as I did it so that ATLUS & SEGA can bring Persona 5 Royal onto steam once they see that the Persona series makes them bank (I will not of course pay for it if the price of the game is ridiculous and instead wait for it to be on sale) on PC, and they finally release a port.",

I WAS PISSED. You would think for a $70 game I I bought deluxe) they would give you a perfect gaming experience but nope. In total it crashed on me about 6-8 times. It was very annoying that you had to do it again. It was horrible and painful. I honestly think we all deserve better than this if we are paying a premium price for a game. \n\nFor the game itself, I personally don't like Dynasty Warrior type of game play but Persona 5 strikers make it fun by adding many elements like fulfilling side quests and meaningful story. I was a bit irritated now I have to go to Playstation 5 for Persona 5 but not playing that beforehand did not affect my understanding to the story. Overall it was a great game, yet there is serious stability issue and I think players should get compensated for going through the hassle of force exit during game play. It wasn't released on early access for goodness sake.",

I'm usually not a fan of Musou game, but this one actually includes a lot of the Persona 5 identity from the main game, and it's always a pleasure to meet the Phantom Thieves one more time !\nHowever, I can't recommend the game right now because of one single (big) issue : the random crashes. In only 4h of playtime, I had 6 crashes, always happening at random moments (in battle, during dialogue...). I save every time it is available, but the game being pretty heavy on dialogue, chances are you will be crashing during one of those and have to restart from the last save point. I had to start a new game 3 times because the game would always crash before I reached the point where the save function gets available... There is nothing more frustrating than finally beating a hard boss then have the game crashes during the dialogue afterwards, forcing you to play the whole section again and pray that this time it won't crash.\nSo until that serious issue is fixed, I can't recommend the game (yet), which is a shame because it is actually a great game.",

The fact that there aren't to many games today that do this is a shame.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really enjoy both turn based and warrior type games, so the switch in style is no problem for me (sad to see the game get some hate on account of this). From my point of view, the way they incorporated Persona 5 mechanics into this game is well done. Even tho there is button mashing involved, I often find myself looking at it from a strategical point of view (which character should I use, what enemy should go down first, what buffs/debuffs to use, should I use SP move or combo etc)\n\nRegarding the story, at this point in time I can't say much, but so far it meets my expectations. I do miss some aspects that have no been included, mostly secondary character stories (as Persona 5 does have some nice characters), but I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.\n\nI did experience some crashes, however in my 30h of gameplay, this only happened twice, none of which have been in crucial moments like boss fights, or even jail exploring, so I can't say I've been bothered that much (would still be nice to get these patched tho).\n\nWhile exploring you will see objects popping in and out of existence, but usually it's small stuff, like rocks and to be honest, most of the time I hardly notice them (since I'm usually looking out for enemies, chests, junk and so on).\n\nDespite the flaws mentioned above, I still think it's a great game and would recommend it to any fan of the series and hope that sometime in the future, we will be able to enjoy Persona 5 Royal as well. ^^",

(Also side note Futaba is still best girl with Takamaki coming in 2nd Makoto comes in 3rd and finally we have Haru) The bonus stuff is actually pretty good with a music player and new music as well as in game stuff to behind the scenes stuff which is pretty cool. It is cheaper to get the deluxe edition bcuz it comes with all the dlc so save yourself $5 and get the deluxe edition. Anyway dope game hopefull we P5 and P5R soon for pc cuz 60 fps is so good for a game like this.",

Played the royal edition the whole summer on my PS4 and coming to play this makes me remember why this series is amazing. This game isn't the same as the other Persona games,but it's still a persona game. Badass OST, stylish finishing moves and other Persona 5 stuff, almost all of it is here. Having to meet Phantom Thieves again was fun[spoiler] Not meeting Akechi though was a bummer [/spoiler]. And there is a lot of fan service [spoiler] The dialogue when Joker acted as a decoy in the first jail was pretty funny ngl(when Ryuji said is this a deja vu and other dialogue that came before it) [/spoiler] I haven't completed the game yet(only finished the first dungeon) but i would give it a 8/10. Totally would recommend!",

        "content": "POST PATCH REVIEW 4/20/2021: It brings me great joy to finally update this review to a storngly recommended, as the newest patch has just released that appears to fix the crashing. I was able to play an additional 2 hours tonight with no crashing, and plan to do a second playthrough on NG+ soon. This game, despite appearances, is not a Warriors game and I mean that in the best way possible. Honestly, this game has no right being as good as it is but honestly it's incredible. Arguably a stronger game, emphasis on game, than the original Persona 5. They've refined nearly every aspect of the combat and Persona fusion systems, and cut a lot of the fat in the social interactions and day-to-day life elements of the game. This is a lean, mean, and extremely enjoyable Persona experience.\n\nThe game is also a surprisingly competent action game. I fully believe that a Level 1 playthrough would be possible based on pure skill alone, as every enemy and boss has clearly telegraphed attacks with unique projectile patterns that can all be evaded. The game never forces you to tank damage and heal like most action RPGs because the damage is unavoidable. With that said, it would be extremely tedious to do this because of how little damage you would be doing in return. However, I think it is an accomplishment in game design that I came away feeling this way.\n\nI only have 3 genuine complaints. First, this game honestly is just \"Persona 5 Again\" in terms of its story. The only surprise you will find here is how blatant the plagarism is. Second, there seems to be a lot of tedious, repetitive, and grindy aspects to this game. However, we all play on PC here and Cheat Engine exists who ultimately you only need to suffer through this if you choose to. Finally, the god damned hooks in Okinawa. You either know what I mean or you will. It's just a terrible decision to make the player wait on this slow hooks in order to progress through the dungeon especially when the characters are clearly able to jump the height required. It's horrible.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommended this game. It's a good deal even at full price, and a great experience for anyone who likes Persona or even Action RPGs.\n\nORIGINAL NEGATIVE REVIEW: This game is actually incredible, but I cannot give it a positive review until the random crashes are fixed. In my playtime, I have experienced nearly 2 dozen crashes and while with habitual saving the consequences can be mitigated it is extremely frustating. I shouldn't have to play in constant fear of random crashes, possibly even caused by the DRM. Until the crashing is resolved, don't buy this.",

        "content": "[b]Persona 5 Strikers[/b] on the surface may seem like another musou-game spinoff. While it certainly draws inspiration from the genre for its core combat, Strikers goes above and beyond in making the game its own, rather than solely adopting the warriors style and nothing else.\n\n[b]The story[/b] follows up several months after the events of the original Persona 5 game. The crew eager for summer vacation discover the metaverse is still active and people are manipulating a new AI program, \"EMMA,\" to steal the desires of those around them for various reasons. They take to the road to sniff out these \"Jails\" and steal back the desires of the public. All in all, the story is pretty fun for what it is, but don't be expecting the same heavy hitting and deeply metaphoric narrative structure Persona 5 had delivered. Strikers definitely reigns it back a bit, and plays out more like a fun action anime tale.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] is pretty addictive. Being a fan of warriors games in the first place, I'm naturally drawn to hack 'n slash fun, but Strikers adds many of its own series' elements to the formula to spice things up. First, you are no longer on a day-by-day system when using the metaverse. Rather, you can phase to-and-fro reality as you please to restock and refresh. The fight encounters are similar to the original persona game, but then the hack 'n slash starts. The key factor here, is that you will be fighting basic shadow hordes, but a lot of Personas as well. This means you have to watch out for your own weaknesses and debuffs, but you can use your team's personas to fight against them as well.\n\nPersona registration, fusion, and strengthening are still here, and being able to collect, mix, and level up personas and skills to help you fight different types of enemies is addictive and just fun.\n\n[b]Music[/b]: of course its great I don't even need to say anything.\n\nIf this game lacks anything, its simply being a spinoff means there are no social links, variable dialogue or story options, etc. Its a very linear action game, so besides your personas and equipment the sense of control and planning isn't really there. But this makes sense, as its is a different class of game, mixing in elements from its true form.\n\nYou don't have to be a fan of hack 'n slash games to enjoy this. If you love action games with flashy visuals and great music, this is for you. And if you simply LOVE persona 5, this is definitely for you, as the entire existence of Strikers simply stands as fan service for the biggest of fans.\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]",

        "content": "Strikers is a beautiful blend of the JRPG and Musuo genres, taking the tight action and combo oriented gameplay of a Musuo and laying it over top a traditional dungeon crawling Persona title. The story is well written, and feels like a true successor to the ORIGINAL Persona 5.\n\n With no references to Royal, due to the different teams in different studios working on these games side by side, it leaves itself open to, potentially, DLC. I would hope for it, but it's doubtful as the game has already been out in Japan for a year without any mention of DLC. It's a fantastic game, if you're a Persona fan, don't let the idea of the combat turn you off, it's executed very well, and more in line with a Persona game that's taking queues from action titles than it does something like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe Phantom Thieves are back, and they've never felt more agile or more stylish, and they're ready to steal your heart once more.",

        "content": "Persona 5 Strikers is not exactly what i was expecting, when this game was first announced it just looked a musou/warriors spin-off game. However after playing it, it does feel more like an Action-RPG than a Musou game.\n\nPersona 5 Strikers in terms of gameplay and story does feel like a true sequel to the original Persona 5. It's gameplay feels like Persona 5's but translated faithfully into an Action-RPG, whenever you encounter enemies instead of transitioning into a turn based-RPG battle, in Strikers it smoothly starts a small Action-RPG/Musou skirmish. The battle system from Persona 5 is actually still sort of present in this game as most of the Persona skills are in this game and work very similarly.\n\nThere is Persona fusion in this game, while it does feel simplified it does feel fun and useful.\n\nEvery party member in this game has a very unique playstyle and is fun to play, it is fun to try out each character and switch up your party trying to find good combinations.\n\nThe Story of Persona 5 Strikers, while i don't think its as strong as the original's story, it still does a lot that I like and has some very strong moments. Also this game feels like a real journey as you go to so many different locations. It's a real change of pace for Persona. Also the chemistry of characters in this game is quite enjoyable.\n\nAlso the new characters introduced in this game are quite likeable, perhaps some of my favourites in the series.\n\nAlso I must mention the soundtrack. It's Persona. It's a complete banger. \n \nNow to talk about performance and quality of this PC port.\nIn my experience it's been pretty good, I have had about four or five crashes, however I never lost any progress from them as I saved my progress every time I had the option. When this game crashes it is usually in a loading screen for a transition so be careful and save.\n\nAlso this game lacks 144hz support which is a shame, it also lacks options to set the level of anti-aliasing, you can only choose for it to be on or off. In 1080p the AA looks pretty bad. However if you are able to run this game with rendering scale 2.0 then do that as it will drastically help remedy the AA. \n\nI played this whole game on Mouse and Keyboard, it is actually pretty fun, moving the camera with my mouse and using m1 and m2 for my attacks. Is it better than controller? \nProbably not, but I found it fun. I did need to remap some stuff however as  some of the default keybinds aren't the greatest. Also while remapping my keybinds I discovered that some binds must always be set on keyboard, which is kinda annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game quite a bit, A great sequel to probably my favourite game of all time.\n\nHopefully we will get more Persona games on PC",

For persona fans this a large departure, time management is not a factor and the battles are real time rather than turn based, at its heart this is an action game with some RPG elements rather than a full on RPG.",

        "content": "Persona 5 meets Musou. This direct sequel to the story of Persona 5 plays similar to the Warriors type games but there are differences that make it feel much more Persona than I had originally expected. For instance, the story is incredibly prevalent and includes longer scenes as you may be used to from Persona. Weaknesses still play a massive role as well. Where I had originally expected a similar style of combat to Dynasty Warriors, I was pleasantly surprised at the tactical depth of this game; button mashing isn't going to get you very far. I would probably say it's more similar to Kingdom Hearts in that regard.\n\nAfter 40 hours, I can say I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. It's very well stylised and I am happy to be playing it on PC. That being said, I - and as far as I've seen, many others as well - have been experiencing crashes. Make sure to save at every chance you have and you shouldn't ever lose much progress. This still screams for a patch, though.\n\nBesides this, my only annoyance is that the menus are relatively slow to navigate. Again, they're very stylish, but having an animation between every sub-menu makes it a bit tedious sometimes. Could just be me, though.\n\nIn short, extremely fun game, plagued by the occasional crash. If you like both Persona and Warrior games, which I do, this is a no-brainer.",

Combat's fun, story is really good, and every single voice actor for this game put their all into their performances (especially Max Mittleman, Ryuji's voice actor, who steals the show in many parts of the game.) Truly recommend if you've played Persona 5. Play with a controller if you have one, as it just feels so much better than M+K.\n\nAlso, I've seen a few negative reviews about this game complaining about performance issues. Now either I am just REALLY lucky or some of these people have no idea what they are talking about. Silky smooth performance (locked at 60 fps granted), not a single crash my entire play through, and the only \"bug\" I encountered was some odd phrasing on an item description.\n\nAlso also, all of you folks who's reviews consist only of \"bring P5 to steam\"..... just be patient and stop whining about it ALL the time. I know a lot of people REALLY want to play this game on PC, but when you are so insistent on endlessly complaining about it, you just look really pathetic.\n\nAlso x3, this games soundtrack absolutely SLAPS.",

        "content": "A very solid game, if you're a fan of Persona 5. The game has a good narrative, that adds fun and good new characters to the universe. I would say that the story is a bit cliche but its follows the standard Persona narrative. If you have played a Persona game you most likely will know where the story is heading.\n\nI had some issues tho, the game continues Persona 5's annoying group dialogue, the group hardly gets to talk about their life's or enjoy the time and instead most of the dialogue is spent talking about the Phantom Thieves instead of something more interesting or funny. This was an issue in the last game and continues to be an issue with this game. Atlus also for some reason chooses to end the group events really quickly. I was very annoyed when this happened since it happened alot during 5, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH THE GROUP AND THEY END IT SO FAST. sorry, but these choices is what makes 5's group a lot more worse than 4's and 3's since the group feels more like the Phantom Thieves instead of a friend group that you can relate to. But if you were fine with it in 5 you will feel the same way about it in this game. \n\nThere is also a lack of optional story content. Most of the optional content is done through requests, that let you go back to previous places to do different challenges to unlock things. All the characters have their own mini side request for you, and all it does is give more dialogue. I felt that this was a huge misfire, i understand not adding a huge side portion of the game, but at least give us a scene or two with these characters by ourselves, to further explore them. They have ONE scene where you get an option to pick one of the characters to go on a trip with you, that's it. Side content is one of the best parts of Persona games and with so little here it makes me a little disappointed.\n\nCombat is very fun. It is also very engaging with many different characters that open different ways to play. The only issue is that certain parts of the game are not very challenging on hard.  Again, with Persona games most of the boss battles are hit or miss, they rely on similar gimmicks to defeat them. Once you learn this gimmicks most boss battles will be finished in the first try. Combat is really fun, like i said, but it seems that because they added so many things to help your character, they really made the game less difficult in the process. \n\nAgain, Atlus does an amazing job with the visuals. The ui in this game is better than the last game, adding flashy things to the ui makes going into a menu much more cooler. The many different places you will visit on your roadtrip are very cool looking. They do a good job capturing the different looks of Japan, from the country side too how different the cities look in the different provinces. The music is also amazing, most tracks return from 5 but the battle music, the backround music, and the remixes of 5's tracks really add alot to the game.\n\n\nI had a few issues with the port. Most of my issues were with crashes during loading, for some reason i had none when in combat. Very annoying since it does not allow you to save whenever you want. \n\n\nEven with my issues with the narrative and other parts of the game, P5 Strikers is still a great experience that i think every Persona fan should play.",

        "content": "i just finished the first \"chapter\" of the game, and i have to say it's absolutely amazing. the gameplay is fun as hell, and quite in depth for a musou style game. every character has a unique gimmick to their movesets, and even joker himself has a TON of variety because of the different personas. you can end a basic combo with Triangle/Y on the controller, and depending on how many attacks you did prior, the finisher will be different, and some of them even use the equipped persona for a skill, while not using SP. this is shown the most with joker, for sure. next is the soundtrack. it's amazing. persona/SMT music has always been amazing, and this is no different. the story is great so far as well. it's just more persona 5, which i'm very much a fan of.\n\nthis game has very few cons, in my opinion at least. i've read some of the negative reviews saying the game is buggy, and borderline unplayable, and frankly that's just false. there's always going to be edge cases, but i've had almost no problems. the game has crashed twice in the about 10 hours i've played, and both times were in loading screens, not random crashes, in the middle of fights, like i've seen some reviews say. i also haven't had any major performance issues either, but i will say the game definitely runs better in exclusive fullscreen rather than borderless windowed.\n\nTL;DR\nthe game is amazing and i highly recommend it, but it does seem to crash every now and then, usually in loading screens, in my experience. the experience is overall better if you've played persona 5 first, since this is a direct sequel, but so you can definitely understand what's going on if you haven't since they provide enough context to make things make sense. but seriously, play persona 5 if you can, preferably royal, since it's way better than base P5.",

They feel much more like a group of friends in this game, everyone feels like they've grown from the past game's events, and all the villains are much more interesting in this game. \nThe game-play is fast and fun, a great mix of the muso and smt based combat. The game did crash on me once so be sure too save often. \nBeat my first play-through on hard, it's not that difficult just make sure you exploit weaknesses and cook sp meals.\n\nPut persona 1 and 2 on steam thx atlus.",

        "content": "Strikers serves as a good sequel to Persona 5. It's not perfect by any means, but it's good. It continues the story of the Phantom Thieves and takes you on a fun adventure with the thieves again. The road trip concept is really fun and you get a lot of interaction between them, though the writing doesn't feel as solid as vanilla P5 or Royal did.\n\nAs someone who's had minimum experience with the warrior series, playing Strikers was easy to get into. However, I would recommend turning off the automatic camera as soon as you can, as it made me confused playing. Also pay close attention to enemy weaknesses and abuse that as much as possible while getting combos and All Out Attacks.\n\nEarly game, try and grind out money as much as you can, upgrading the bond that raises money gain and bond exp asap. It gets easier as the game goes on but I find myself running out of money quite often if you wanna gear up your entire team at once.\n\nBeing able to pause the game to use Persona skills or items is very nice and allows you to think about your next move.\n\nThe game does feel lackluster in some areas though, most notably in dungeon length and some story elements. Some dungeons are longer than others, while a few are only floor long. They don't spend a whole lot of time on some characters or moments either and some characters feel one dimensional. But if you're just looking for a good time and wanna smash some buttons and are a fan of the Phantom Thieves, I would recommend it.",

        "content": "Summary: Gameplay is fun, a true sequel to Persona 5, but crashes, and a lack of good PC mainstay features makes it a bad purchase.\n\nHardware: \nR7 1700X \n16GB RAM\nGTX 1070\n2560x1080 75hz Monitor\n\nI have had roughly TEN crashes. The number of times this game crashes is absolutely insane.\nNot to mention, the default controls for the game are terrible with Keyboard and Mouse, making it damn near unplayable without a controller. And the keybind settings are mediocre at best.\n\nGraphical settings wise, the game lacks ultrawide support, which is a huge point against it for me personally. The game ALSO does not apparently support refresh rates above 60Hz (as modders have discovered it is apparently tied to game speed), meaning that I can't take full advantage of my 75Hz monitor. Most games also feature a way to pause when tabbed out, or to keep the game running, which P5S lacks, making some situations annoying (I.E. game pauses when I respond to a friend on discord, etc). Other than that, the game looks beautiful and I haven't had any minor or large graphical glitches yet.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that I'm able to clear up to an hours worth of content, and then the game crashes, making me replay it. Since the game is actually pretty tough on higher difficulties, and grinding isn't really a viable option, this is extremely frustrating. Until these issues are fixed, I CANNOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME. If you would like to support the Devs, purchase the game on another platform. Do NOT reward shitty ports. The game IS fun when it works, and I'd recommend it, but the state of the PC port is rather poor and I cannot personally recommend it from my experience.\n\nAlso, Atlus, please give us SMT V on PC.",
